Important disclosures can be fo und in the Disclosures Appendix. 1 weekly market view m acro strategy | 5 January 2018 This reflects the views of the Wealth Management Group Editorial A strong start to 2018 Global equities and EM assets have extended their rally into the new year. S trong data, US tax cuts and still - loose global monetary policies are likely to keep supporting risk assets . Equities: T ax cuts have lifted earnings expectations for the US financia l sector, a preferred sector . Strong Euro area fundamental s are likely to overcome the impact of a strong EUR . Bonds: EM USD government bonds and Asia USD bonds, our preferred area s , likely to continue benefitting from capital flows . FX: The USD is likely to extend its decline after a brief pause. We turn bearish on USD\/SGD , which fell below a support level. See Outlook 2018: Turning up the heat , published o n 8 December, for more details on our k ey investment themes . Strong fundamentals sustain equity rally . G lobal stocks have scaled new highs since we published Outlook 2018 , led by Emerging Markets and the US . Strong business confidence data in the US, Euro area and Japan for December portend above - trend global growth for the second straight year in 2018. In Asia, while economy continues to moderate, services sector business confidence is rising . growth in December suggests global trade remains resilient. US tax cuts are likely to support consumption and boost corporate profits, especially in the financial sector . Monetary policies are also likely to remain supportive for risk assets. The solid fundamentals support our continued preference for equities (especially in Asia ex - Japan and the Euro area) over bonds. USD falls further . The USD continued its decline for the third week, despite s minutes that show most members support a gradual rise in interest rates. While the USD remains oversold, we believe any USD rebound is likely to be temporary, given a gradual rise in US rates is unlikely to surprise markets. We would go short EM assets benefit as a wea k USD to support capital in flows . Emerging Market (EM) USD government bonds and Asia USD bonds , our preferred areas in bonds, have delivered flat - to - positive returns over the past month despite the rise in US Treasury yields. A w eaker USD and strong global economic data ha ve supported the bonds, leading to a decline in yield premium over US Treasuries. We remain comfortable adding exposure. What we are watching US, Euro area government bond yields , inflation . The 10 - year US Treasury and German B und yields have trended higher over the past month, edging close to the top of t he range set over the past year following US tax cuts ( which ra ise the risk of a higher fiscal deficit), continued strong economic data and marginally hawkish central bank comments . We would follow Fed speeches (several are scheduled over the coming week) , US inflation and ECB meeting minutes closely , given that faster - than - expected policy tightening is a key risk to our constructive outlook.

Global stocks scaled new record highs, led by Emerging Markets and the US . EM local currency bonds led gains in debt market as the USD continued to weaken. Crude oil extended gains amid political unrest in Iran, a key supplier. Equities : Rally e xtends into the new year US tax cuts to boost financial sector profits . US corporate t ax cuts are likely to benefit the US financial sector the most , as it has a domestic focus and pays high effective tax rates compared to other sectors. This view is supported by rising earnings forecasts, with consensus estimates for earnings growth in 2018 for the financial sector rising to 18%, from a forecast of 12% in October 2017. US financials remain a preferred sector. Euro area fundamentals to overcome impact of strong EUR . Euro area equities have come under pressure from EUR strength despite strong economic data . We acknowledge that currency strength is a drag on both corporate p erformance and sentiment , given more than 50% of corporate revenue comes from outside the Euro area. Nevertheless, we believe the current weakness in Euro area equities is likely to be temporary; we believe further USD weakness is likely to be only modest in 2018 and strong Euro area fundamentals are likely to overcome the negative impact on corporate profit s from EUR strength. Hong Kong stocks driven by southbound flows . The Hang Seng rose to its highest since 2007. The Hong Kong\/China Stock Connect is expected to continue to be a key driver of ma rket performance in 2018. Southbound flows via the Stock C onnect now accounts for 10% of the average daily turnover in Hong Kong, up from 5% in early 2017. China , including Hong Kong - listed exposure , rem ains a preferred equity market in Asia . Bonds : Contin ue rotation into our preferred EM bonds EM bonds preferred. Since the publication of our O utlook 2018 , 10 - year US Treasury yields a nd German Bund yields have risen by over 10bps due to a combination of the impact from the US tax reform, strong economic data and marginally hawkish comments from central bank policymakers. Emerging Market (E M) bonds still delivered positive returns despite this rise in Developed Market yields . We would continue to rotate into our preferred are as (EM USD government and Asia USD) as the latter offer a more attractive balance of yield and quality , in our view . FX : Bearish on USD\/SGD; c autious against chasing AUD higher Turning bearish on USD\/SGD . The USD\/SGD pair broke below a key support (1.334) , which now confirms a continuation of the downtrend , in our view . The break came after the announcement - than - consensus Q4 GDP growth data. The immediate focus is on support at 1.3270 - 1.3150, which includes the 50% retracement of the rally from the 2011 low and the 2015 low. Against this backdrop, we now shift our bias in USD\/SGD to bearish, preferring to sell any short - term rebounds towards 1.334. Retain negative bias on AUD \/USD . The AUD rose to its highest since October following s trong global PMI numbers, buoyant investor sentiment and higher iron ore prices export. Technically, however, the AUD appears to be testing an important resistance (0.784); this corresponds with its Q2 16 top (daily chart) and is close to the 200 - week moving average (weekly chart). Without a sustained break above 0.784, we remain cautious and retain our bias to sell AUD at these levels .

How have markets panned out relative to your expectations since you published the a nnual o utlook? The strong momentum in global equity and corporate bond markets continued through the past month since we published our Outlook 2018 . Since we published on 8 December , global equities have risen 3.9 %, within which Emerging Markets (EMs) outperformed with a 7.6 % rise. Global investment grade corporate bonds rose 0.8 %, while E M USD government bonds were up 0.9 %. The US D continued to weaken ( - 2.2 %) , but both oil (+8.0 %) and gold (+5.9 %) recorded strong gains. These strong gains occurred against the backdrop of key events and economic data that were supportive for markets. The Fed raised rates along expected lines , while the US government made significant progress toward implementing the tax reform. In our Outlook 2018 , we argued the case for a move towards ref lation (ie , one characteri s ed by strong growth and modestly accelerating inflation), an environment we believe would favour equities outperforming bonds, with Asia ex - J apan and Euro area equities outperforming other regions, EM s outperforming Developed Mar kets ( DM ) within bonds and the US D weakening modestly. While one month is too short a time to pass judgment on these full - year views, the past month has been a good start. Continued robust growth and a modest uptick in inflation in December ha ve been cons istent with our broad view of a continued shift towards reflation. Our view that equities are likely to outperform bonds is off to a strong start, though within that , our regional preference for Asia ex - Japan has done better than our preference for Euro ar ea. Similarly, EM USD government bonds have done a better job of outperforming global bonds than Asia USD bonds, which have lagged somewhat. The USD has weakened in line with our expectations, but the continued, steady rise in oil prices has been greater t han expected. Q 2 . T he USD index fell to its lowest level in three months earlier in the week. Overall, 2017 was the worst year for the USD since 2003, despite the Fed hik ing rates thrice last yea r. This would suggest the USD is no longer reacting to the cyclical upturn in the US economy , and developments elsewhere in the global economy might be more important to follow. In particular, the pace at which the ECB decides to move towards policy normal i s ation will be critical. ECB Executive Board M ember Benoit Coeure recently hinted markets we re underestimating the pace and extent of Euro area monetary policy tightening. Indeed, Euro area economic momentum has remained consistently strong and this could lead to a faster unwinding of policy stimulus than what markets currently expect. The USD finally got some relief on Wednesday following stron g US 12 - 13 December meeting. Although these held few surprises , it was nonetheless supportive for an increasingly oversold USD , which had been declining for the past three weeks. However, we continue to be lieve any USD rebounds higher will prove to be temporary. Technically, the DXY index impulsively broke below the neckline support of the head - and - shoulders pattern , a bearish outcome . We would remain bearish unless there is a break above the resistance at the neckline level at 92.20 . However, a breach of the next major resistance at 93.4 0 is needed to reverse the downtrend .
