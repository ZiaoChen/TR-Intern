I005dfe10fa0111e69db2d33848f9cf4d.1C,"板块轮流炒
高追恐遇险内地股市昨天轻微回调，沪深指数分别下跌0.3%及0.11%。此前累积较大升幅的水泥股昨天回吐逾3%，成为表现最差的板块；医药股接力向上，逆市上升逾1%，表现最佳。股市大涨小回及板块轮流炒作的特点尚未转变，投资者仍可维持对优质股份逢低吸纳的策略。沪指昨收报3251点，两市总成交金额为5181亿元（人民币．下同），比前日略增约160亿元。笔者此前已提过，若A股成交金额未见进一步上升，维持在5000亿元的水平，沪指恐怕仍要在3200点附近横行。本周以来，上证的表现亦大致如是，且看下周两会临近，能否带来新突破。在资金有限的情况下，继续在不同板块间轮流炒作。过去一个月升逾一成的水泥板块，昨天出现强劲回吐。前日升逾5%的金隅（601992.SH），昨天跌5%，打回原形；前日涨停的尖峰集团（600668.SH）及祁连山（600720.SH），昨天亦分别回吐5%及4%。近期没有受到太多关注的生物製药板块，昨天逆市受捧，整体上升1.1%。其中，葵花药业（002737.SZ）及亿帆医药（002019.SZ）涨停、益佰制药（600594.SH）升9.9%、人福医药（600079.SH）升6.8%、康弘药业（002773.SZ）升4.7%、北陆药业（300016.SZ）升4.1%。医药股之所以受到关注，或与近期官方积极推动的医改有关。人社部网站近日公布了新版《国家基本医疗保险、工伤保险和生育保险药品目录（2017年版）》，新增363个品种。其中，以中药企业的受惠最大，有两百多个品种得以加入名单。包括益佰制药在内的多家上市中药企业，均有多个产品入围。昨天另一隻逆市涨停的股份，还包括鼎泰新材（002352.SZ），该股之所以有如此突出的表现，主要因为被顺丰速运借壳上市。顺丰近日公布，预计2016年度营业总收入574.83亿元，同比增长21.51%；归属于上市公司股东的淨利润为41.8亿元，同比增长112.51%。严打抽水收紧再融资顺丰的利润不但接近内地主要快递企业「三通一达」（即圆通、中通、申通、韵达）的业绩总和，而且扣除非经常性损益后归属于上市公司股东的淨利润约为
26.43亿元，亦比借壳上市时所承诺的21.8亿元利润为多。在网购需求持续增长下，顺丰前景仍然乐观。顺丰速运借壳鼎泰新材的工作其实已进行了一段时间，鼎泰新材近日之所以大涨，主要因为市场误传该股今日会正式改名为顺丰控股。不过，其后公司澄清，顺丰尚未正式上市，时间仍待公布。最近一段时间，内地股市监管趋严，政府有意打压在市场肆意「抽水」的行为。所以，近期便宣布，要收紧企业再融资的限制。有内地媒体统计发现，过往A股上市企业在股市大力「抽水」，派息分红的金额却微不足道。统计显示，过往透过批股等方式在股市进行再融资，金额超过100亿元的公司共有115家。不过，当中只有11家公司累计现金分红金额超过其「抽水」量。资金一去无回头，部分企业更是不断「抽水」以填补亏损，但经营效益一直未见改善。内地股市需要好好整治，相信证监会仍会推出更多规管政策。传郭树清接掌中银监有消息指出，曾任内地证监会主席的郭树清将会接替即将退休的尚福林，担任银监会主席。属于改革派的郭树清上任，或有为银行业带来一番新景象。事实上，目前银行业最大的问题在于表外贷款，有关影子银行、高息理财产品等所带来的风险持续受到关注。所以，郭树清上任后预计会收紧对此类业务的监管，对整体金融安全有利，但对银行短期利润或有负面影响，值得留意。

","Plate rotation speculation
High chase and fear of distress Mainland stocks slightly retreated yesterday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock indexes fell 0.3% and 0.11%. Cement stocks, which had accumulated a large increase earlier, shed more than 3% yesterday and became the worst performing sector. Pharmaceutical stocks relayed the upward trend and surged over 1% against the market, which showed the best performance. Stock market ups and downs and plate turns speculation features have not changed, investors can still maintain the strategy of absorbing high bargain stakes. Stock index closed at 3251 points yesterday, the total turnover of 518.1 billion yuan (RMB. The same below), an increase of about 160 billion yuan over the previous day. I have already mentioned before, if the amount of A-share turnover no further rise to maintain the level of 500 billion yuan, stock index probably still in the vicinity of 3200 rampant. This week, the performance of the Shanghai Stock Exchange is also roughly the case, and look next week will approaching, can bring a new breakthrough. In the case of limited funds, continue to take turns in different sections speculation. The cement sector, which rose more than 10% in the past month, showed a strong take-back yesterday. Gold Corner (601992.SH), which rose more than 5% on the previous day, slipped 5% yesterday to regain the original shape. The ex-day rush-hour Spirits Group (600668.SH) and Qilian Hill (600720.SH) yesterday retreated 5% and 4 %. The biopharmaceutical sector, which has not received much attention recently, was hit by the adverse market yesterday with an overall increase of 1.1%. Among them, Sunflower Pharmaceutical (002737.SZ) and billion fan medicine (002019.SZ) daily limit, Guizhou Yibai Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd. (600594.SH) rose 9.9%, Humanwell Healthcare (Group) Co.,Ltd. Pharmaceutical 600079.SH) rose 6.8%, Chengdu Kanghong Pharmaceuticals Group Co.,Ltd (002773.SZ) rose 4.7%, Hokuriku Pharmaceutical (300016.SZ) rose 4.1%. The reason for the attention of the pharmaceutical stocks, or with the recent official promotion of health reform related. The website of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security recently released a new edition of ""National Basic Medical Insurance, Industrial Injury Insurance and Maternity Insurance Catalog of Drugs (2017 Edition)"", adding 363 new varieties. Among them, the largest beneficiaries of Chinese medicine companies, more than 200 varieties to be added to the list. Many listed Chinese medicine companies, including Guizhou Yibai Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd.,have selected several products. Yesterday another counter-inflation daily limit, including S.F. Holding Co.,Ltd. (002352.SZ), the reason why the stock has so outstanding performance, mainly because of SF Express backdoor listing. SF announced recently that operating revenue in 2016 is expected to reach 57.483 billion yuan, an increase of 21.51% over the same period of last year. Net profit attributable to shareholders of the listed company was 4.18 billion yuan, an increase of 112.51% over the same period of last year. Striking Pumping Tightening and Refinancing SF Profit not only approaches the total business performance of the ""three direct links"" (ie Yuantong, Zhongtong, Shen Tong and Yun Da), the major express delivery companies in the Mainland, but also net of shareholders attributable to the Company after deducting non-recurring gains and losses Profit is about
2.643 billion yuan, more than the 2.18 billion yuan profit committed when it was listed on the backdoor. Under the continuous growth of online shopping demand, SF outlook is still optimistic. SF Holding Co.,Ltd. has actually been in operation for some time. The reason why SF Holding Co.,Ltd. rose sharply recently was mainly because the market misstated the stock will be officially renamed as SF Holding Co. today, Ltd. However, the company later clarified, SF has not yet officially listed, the time remains to be announced. Recently, the stock market supervision in the Mainland toughened the government intends to suppress the market in the wanton ""pumping"" behavior. Therefore, we recently announced that we should tighten the restrictions on refinancing of enterprises. According to statistics from the Mainland media, in the past, A-share listed companies vigorously ""pumped water"" in the stock market. However, the dividend payment was insignificant. Statistics show that in the past through refinancing of stocks and other means in the stock market, a total of more than 10 billion yuan of the company a total of 115. However, only 11 of them have accumulated cash dividends exceeding their ""pumping"" amount. As soon as funds go back, some companies continue to ""pump water"" to cover their losses, but their operating efficiency has not seen any improvement. The mainland stock market needs a good remediation and I believe the SFC will still introduce more regulatory policies. Biography Guo Shuqing took over the China Banking Regulatory Commission Some news pointed out that former Chairman of the Mainland Securities Commission Guo Shuqing will succeed Shang Fulin, who will retire, as the CBRC chairman. Guo Shuqing, a reformist, took office or has brought some new scenes to the banking industry. In fact, the biggest problem currently facing the banking sector lies in off-balance sheet lending. The risks associated with shadow banking and high-interest wealth management products continue to attract attention. Therefore, after taking office, Guo Shuqing is expected to tighten the supervision over such businesses and is good for the overall financial security. However, it is worth noting that the short-term profits of banks may have a negative impact.",板块轮流炒 高追恐遇险,Not Reuters,05:07AM 12 Oct 2016,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I005dfe10fa0111e69db2d33848f9cf4d.1C.html

","US dollar weakened against Yoyojin but bullish outlook due to Fed rate hike * USDJPY declined but US dollar outlook remains bright * US data consolidates US rate hike *
New Zealand dollar tumbled 1.5% on New Zealand central bank policy outlook Reuters NEW YORK, May 11 -
The dollar fell against the yen on the first day of trading within five trading days on Thursday, as concerns over the sudden expulsion of FBI chief Komi from U.S. President Donald Trump due to investors adjusting their positions after the recent rally hurt the dollar. ""We do need the stimulus of new triggers because the daily materials we tracked show that the USD / JPY has overbought,"" said Mark Dow, chief North American director of currency strategy at TD Securities
McCormick said. However, the outlook for the U.S. dollar remains rosy. In particular, the good U.S. data on Thursday consolidated the expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month. Data show that U.S. jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week, and the producer price index rebounded strongly in April. ""Although a series of economic data in the United States showed signs of weakness in March, there appears to be a rebound in April,"" said James James, head of research at Forex.com
Chen said. He added that recent reports support the Fed's interest rate hike in June. According to Macroeconomic
Advisers, the United States in the second quarter economy is expected to grow 3.9% after data released on Thursday. According to CME's FedWatch, the interest rate futures market expects the chances for the Fed to tighten policy again next month to 85%. However, the news that Comic expelled still weighs on the dollar, analysts said, may curb the dollar against the yen rise. A few days before the removal of President Trump, Secretary of the FBI said to members of Congress that he was seeking more resources to investigate whether collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia would affect 2016 U.S. election. Meanwhile, the pound hit a one-week low against the dollar after the Bank of England's inflation report showed it is unlikely to raise interest rates in the next two years. The pound was down 0.5% at 1.2880. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-1 to keep interest rates unchanged at a record low of 0.25%. [nZRS260J04] In late afternoon New York, the dollar fell 0.4% against the safe-haven yen to 113.87 yen, while the safe-haven CHF fell 0.2% to 1.0073 Swiss francs. The dollar index
Down 0.1% to 99.625. The New Zealand dollar also fell to a nearly one-year low after RBNB reiterated its policy neutral stance by warning investors that the outlook was incorrectly interpreted and the central bank also expressed its approval of the New Zealand dollar's fall this year. (Finish)

林郑压倒胜三位候选人若论才干、资历、政绩、政治品格、远见卓职，过往见得到的政治考验表现，人脉关係，尤其是与公务员团队的合作，以及最重要的中央政府信任度等条件来说，毫无疑问都是林郑被社会大众看高一
，取得压倒性优势，这是各种民调反映的客观事实。倘若从选举工程来看，曾俊华的竞选工程无论规模、攻略、包装、众筹、造势、公关，应变以及社交平台等等各方面都堪称一绝，无疑这也是同他早已蓄势待发，深谋远虑，以及很早就起步有关。林郑仓卒参选，已失先机，各项选举工程都只能急就章地追赶。胡国兴则只靠匹夫之勇，更毫无选举工程可言。再剖析整个政治态势及群情对比，以及媒体舆论影响社群的形势，基本格局没有根本改变。更重要的方面还在从选委中建制与非建制力量对比的分析，原属建制阵营或亲建制的选委人数，较之二○一二年第四任行政长官选举的形势更恶劣。多个功能组别的选委议席都全数成为非建制囊中之物。选举形势对于林郑要争胜更艰巨。上述四项元素的较量，对比与变化，都会影响选情，尤其是反对派阵营对本次特首选举，採取新的策略，更令选情存在许多变数。揭反对派「造王」来龙去脉反对派总结过往派人参选失败的经验，在这次选举中不派人直接参选，改为「造王」策略。利用集结反对派阵营的选票，作为缔结「城下之盟」的本钱，俘虏「建制派」候选人为其所用。从而妄图达到分裂建制派阵营力量，製造建制阵营内鬨，达到「明修栈道，暗度陈仓」以抢夺香港管治最高权力的目的。对此，《星岛日报》率先发表卢文端先生的分析，已十分透彻地揭穿反对派「造王」的来龙去脉。让公众可以透视种种造势现象之背后的惊心动魄的较量。林郑月娥最终能够高票当选，实在是两大阵营的生死搏斗的对决结果。建制派阵营之所以能够取胜，完全是靠来自阵营内各界别、各行业、各阶层的选委委员的爱国爱港大团结，求同存异，甚至求大同、存大异。人人都以维护「一国两制」，国家统一，香港繁荣安定，确保基本法得以完整实施为大目标。在此大原则下，人同此心、心同此理，全力以赴，支持获中央信任、又得市民支持，并有治港能力的林郑月娥「女娲炼石补青天」。经过本次行政长官选举的洗礼，「香港营」又重新在新的历史条件下建立起来了！王国兴23万监察

","The ""Hong Kong Battalion"" has re-established the high proportion of the number of votes reached by the number of votes of the Chief Executive, lasted for 777 days. The number of votes cast by Leung Chun-ying was over 88% ticket. Mr Tsang Chun-wah had only 395 votes and Mr Kwok-sing had only 21 votes. Voting results showed the founding camp was overwhelming and the opposition failed to ""make the king."" On a number of conditions
Lin Zheng Overcome Wins Three Candidates If there is discussion on the merits, qualifications, performance, political character, far-sightedness and job performance of the past, the political tests and political connections we have seen in the past, especially with the civil service team and the most important central government trust And other conditions, there is no doubt that Lin Zheng was a high school look
, Made overwhelming advantage, which is reflected in all kinds of public opinion objective facts. If we look at the electoral projects, there is no doubt that this is a matter of fact that he has long been ready to compete with him in terms of scale, strategy, packaging, crowdfunding, power-ups, public relations, contingency and social platforms. Foresight, and early start on. Lin hastily elected, has lost the first opportunity, the election project can only rush to catch up. Hu Guoxing relied on the courage of each other, but there was no election project at all. An analysis of the entire political situation and the comparison of mass media situation and the influence of media and media on the community have not fundamentally changed the basic pattern. A more important aspect is the analysis of the comparison of the strength of formation and non-formation from the election of members. The number of electioneering constituencies originally formed or pro-formed is even worse than the election of the fourth-term chief executive in 2012. All functional constituencies have become non-constitutional members of the Commission. The election situation is more arduous for Lin Zheng to win the competition. The above four elements of the contest, comparison and change will affect the election, especially the opposition camp for this Chief Executive Election, to adopt a new strategy, but also to make the election there are many variables. Uncovering the Opposition ""Governing the King"" Achilles heel The opposition summed up its past experience of sending people unsuccessful in participating in the election. Instead of sending direct candidates for election, the strategy of ""making the king"" was replaced in this election. Using the votes of the assembled opposition camps as the capital for concluding the ""alliance under the city"", prisoners of ""constitutional faction"" were chosen for their use. In a vain attempt to achieve the goal of building a camp of separatist construction forces and coaxing the built-up camps so as to achieve the goal of ""ascertaining the path of the plains and placing them in darkness"" in order to plunder the supreme power of Hong Kong's administration. In response, ""Sing Tao Daily"" took the lead in publishing an analysis by Mr LO Weng-tuan and has thoroughly revealed the origins and origins of the opposition ""making the king."" So that the public can see through all kinds of momentum behind the thrilling contest. Lin Cheng-e can eventually vote for the top vote, it is the result of the battle between the two camps. The reason why the founding camp can win lies solely in the unity of patriotism and love of Hong Kong with its members from all walks of life in the camp, industries and walks of life. It seeks common ground while reserving differences. All people regard the principle of ""one country, two systems"", the unification of the country, the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and ensuring the full implementation of the Basic Law as a major goal. Under this principle, people work with the same heart and heart, go all out to support the loyalty of the Central Government and their support to the community.

I0411b720473811e7af08f6d1e6678afd.1C,"加入热厨房穿过窄门缝候任特首林郑月娥的班子最终敲定，最后拍板的位置是发展局局长。早期她属意由前立法会议员谢伟铨出任，消息曝光之后，有很多反对声音，指他与发展商关係密切，结果阵前易帅，改为邀请发展局常秘黄伟纶出任发展局局长，新班子终于齐脚。
二十一个候任问责官员之中，有十个由现届问责班子人员原职留任，包括三个司长。另外十个官员是现有班子的副局长升任局长，或者由公务员系统擢升。外来人只有一个，就是来自泛民的劳福局局长罗致光。对这个新班子的构成，有几点观察。
第一是这个厨房热度太高，外人不易入局，结果最高级的三司都未找到新人接棒。五年前在一个局长离任的送别饭局之中，大家谈到未来问责班子的走势。我当时已觉得问责班子这个厨房的热度不断上升，将来愈来愈难找外人入局。五年过后，情况更严重。
香港是一个重商社会，精英主要在商界发展，他们无不与商界有千丝万缕的关係。即使有雄心壮志，愿意放弃高薪厚职入局，但由于与商界的联繫，很容易会出事。以谢伟铨阵前失蹄事件为例，「曾为发展商打工」这个「缺点」本来相当遥远，但也成为一种水洗不清的疑点，最终令当事人却步。只有像罗致光这些来自泛民的外来人，相对受到较少攻击，入局的信心也较大。
第二是外人难找，公务员精英出头。虽然来届政府没有很多外面的勐人加入，但也不能说团队没有战斗力。看几个从公务员提拔上来的局长，例如将任政制局局长的聂德权，将任发展局局长的黄伟纶以及将任运房局局长的陈帆，都是「打得」人士。聂德权和黄伟纶都是AO之中的精英，是官场的今日之星。两人都署任D8（首长八级）位置，并未升正，如今离开公务员队伍，加入问责班子，意味茈L们的退休金及长俸收入要有一定的牺牲。他们愿意加入问责团队，皆有一定的抱负和勇气。
至于候任运房局局长的陈帆，原本是机电工程署署长，是专业职系官员。今次将成为专业官员变成问责局长的范例。这几位都是公务员精英，加入问责团队，担当相当吃重的位置，未来班子是否打得，除了看特首之外，就要睇他们如何展现实力了。
第三是新班子要在中央和反对派的窄缝中，走出新路。我一直说林郑月娥不是「CY
2.0」，而是「煲呔0.5」。她不想如CY那样以强硬风格治港，想对泛民搞怀柔政策，特别想与民主党和解。
但在这场政治游戏当中，阿爷也是一大玩家。北京与泛民关係时好时坏，不易全面和解。若政府政策太倾向泛民，也易招建制派之忌，倒过头会向阿爷投诉。林郑月娥的新班子要拉拢泛民，又不致激发中央太大反应，当中要很高的平衡艺术。
弄得好，可以为未来特区政府管治走出新局面，减少立法会的对抗，令到政府可以顺利施政。但弄不好的话，就变成两面不讨好，引火烧身。如果穿过这道很窄的门缝，不但要打得，还要很高的技术。「巴士的报」是一份网上报纸，让网民随时随地拿茪熅魕峊酊O电脑可以看到。wh.lo@bastillepost.com•逢周二至六见报

","Join the hot kitchen through the narrow gap between the Chief Executive Lin Cheng-long team eventually finalized, the final position of the Secretary for Development. In the early stage, she was intended to be appointed by the former Legislative Councilor TSE Wai-chuen. After the news was exposed, there were many objections that he was closely connected with the developers. The result was that the front was so handsome and invited Dr Wong Wai-lun, the Permanent Secretary of the Development Bureau, to be the Secretary for Development. Qi feet.
Of the 21 incumbent officials responsible for accountability, 10 are currently staffed by current accountable officers, including three directors. Ten other officials are promoted to the posts of Deputy Secretaries of the existing posts or they are promoted by the civil service. There is only one foreign person, that is, Luo Zhiguang, director of the Labor and Welfare Bureau of Pan-people. What is the composition of this new team?
The first is the kitchen heat is too high, outsiders are not easy to enter, the result of the most senior three did not find the new take over. Five years ago, in a farewell dinner hosted by the Secretary, everyone talked about the trend of the accountability team in the future. At that time, I thought that the heat of the accountability team in the kitchen was on the rise and that it was more and more difficult to find outsiders in the future. After five years, the situation is even worse.
Hong Kong is a mercantilist company. Elitegroup Computer Systems Co.,Ltd. is mainly developed in the business community. They are inextricably linked to the business community. Even with ambitions, they are willing to give up their high-paying and high-employment positions, but because of their links with the business community, they are prone to accidents. Taking the example of the defeat of Xie Weicheng in the past, the ""shortcoming"" of ""having worked for developers"" was quite far away. However, it has also become a kind of unsure suspense and eventually deterred the parties. Only those foreign people like Luo Zhiguang, who came from pan-people, are relatively less attacked and have greater confidence in entering the country.
The second is hard to find outsiders, civil servants Elitegroup Computer Systems Co.,Ltd.. Although the current government does not have many outside Meng joined, but can not say that the team has no combat effectiveness. Look at some of the bureaux promoted by civil servants, such as Ned Tak-kwan, who will serve as Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Mr Wong Wai-lun who will serve as Secretary for Development and Mr Chan as Secretary for Transport Operations, all ""beaten"" persons. Nie Dequan and Huang Wei Lun are among the AO Elitegroup Computer Systems Co.,Ltd.,is the official star today. Both of them have not taken the position of D8 (Chief Executive Eighth) and have not risen. Now that they leave the civil service and join the accountability team, they have to sacrifice their pensions and pensions. They are willing to join the accountability team, all with a certain ambition and courage.
As for the Director of Transport for Transport, Fan Chen, originally director of the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, is a professional grade officer. This will be an example of a professional officer becoming an accountability bureau chief. These are all civil servants Elitegroup Computer Systems Co.,Ltd.,join the accountability team, take a rather heavy position, the future team is playing, in addition to looking at the chief executive, it is necessary to watch them how to show their strength.
The third is that the new team should get out of the new road in the narrow gap between the Central Government and the opposition. I have always said that Mrs Lam is not ""CY
2.0 "", but"" 煲 呔 0.5 "". She did not want to rule Hong Kong in a hard-line style like CY did, and she wanted to engage in a humane policy toward pan-people. She especially wanted to reconcile with the Democratic Party.
However, in this political game, Asya is also a big player. The relationship between Beijing and pan-people is good and bad and not easy to be reconciled in all aspects. If the government policy is too inclined to Pan-people, it is easy to recruit the establishment of the system's bogey, turned away and complained to the Lord. The new team of Mrs. Lam's Yue-woo will try to win over the pan-pro people and will not arouse too much reaction from the Central Government.
Well done can help the SAR government get rid of the new situation and reduce the confrontation of the Legislative Council in the future, so that the government can successfully administer its affairs. But if you do not get it, it will turn into a two-sided thank-you note. If you cross this very narrow door, not only to play, but also a very high technology.

I044f7f80135b11e78c64f404e7c3580b.1C,"大和解的崎岖路林郑月娥当选特首，她在胜选宣言提到，上任后首要工作是修补撕裂及解开鬱结，团结大家向前。她又提到会马上约晤立法会各党派议员，并希望建立痡`沟通机制。她又说组织管治团队要用人唯才，不论派别都会诚意邀请他们加入，似是想延揽泛民人士入阁。
这些说话有点似曾相识，林郑走的是想和泛民「大和解」的路线，她真的如选前我估计那样，她不是「CY2.0」，不是在政治上走较紧贴中央的强硬路线。她是「煲呔0.5」，想走一条拉拢泛民的「大和解」道路，但在客观环境限制下，这条路比「煲呔曾」的时代更难行。
有人针对林郑的民望，我觉得她竞选起步甚迟，民望落后于曾俊华不足为奇，真正问题是她上任之后，能否逐步拉升民望。
我们可以回顾过去三个特首的民望，都是先高后低，煲呔曾更惨的是坐监收场。他们的高民望初上任岁月，各有前因。董伯伯是回归第一任特首，香港第一次不再由英国人派来的港督治港，觉得非常新鲜，所以他初时的高民望是天赐的，其他人学不来。到董伯伯后期，在政治上因23条立法饱受泛民狙击，在经济民生上又因为沙士和楼价暴跌而民怨沸腾，民望急泻。
到「煲呔曾」上台，经济民生上是「行运医生医病尾」，在中央开放自由行支持下，香港经济走出谷底。政治上就打出「大和解」的旗帜，民望水涨船高。到「煲呔曾」管治尾段，政治上未出大事，但楼价开始急上，再加上受到官商勾结的质疑，亦衰收尾。
CY在二○一二年选举前经营了两年，主要落区见基层，在经济民生上主打「反地产霸权」牌。民望逐步超过对手唐唐，直致胜选。但CY上台亦背负僭建的原罪，加上政治上比较紧跟阿爷的路线，所以民望下滑。而他的「反地产霸权」历史，就令部份商界不支持他，结果未够支持票去再次参选。
回看过去的特首，他们抢夺民意支持的手法，主要是两条路线，若不是在经济上针对财团打击霸权，就是在政治上亲近泛民疏远阿爷，这两种手法有得亦有失，「反霸权」路线走得太深，就失却财团选票，下届难连选连任。「大和解」行得太过，就失却阿爷的政治支持，下场可能更惨。做特首抢民望如走钢线，走过一分，掉下来就粉身碎骨。
如果林郑是走和「煲呔曾」类似的大和解路线，她面对的局限会比「煲呔曾」更多。第一，独派和激进派兴起，会大大约束泛民和新特首妥协的动机。泛民会怕再在特首拉线下，和阿爷在重大政治问题上达成协议，会成为下次选举的硬伤，被激进派狙击抢票。
第二，独派和激进派兴起亦令阿爷退却空间有限。就以之前政府入禀DQ第二批四个议员为例，若政府想半途而废放弃打官司，和泛民和解，阿爷会同意吗？在阿爷的眼中，放生独派，他们不会收敛，还是不断抢夺政府权力，最后不可收拾。
即使林郑想做媒人，但双方不想拍拖，最后也难成好事。当然，推动和解良好愿望值得鼓励，我也觉得香港政治吵闹太多，愈来愈讨厌。「巴士的报」是一份网上报纸，让网民随时随地拿茪熅魕峊酊O电脑可以看到。逢周二至六见报wh.lo@bastillepost.comwww.bastillepost.com

","As the chief executive of the rugged road Jeung Yuk-eun said on her declaration of victory, the chief task after taking office is to repair and torn up and unite the people. She also mentioned that she would immediately meet with legislature parties and hope to establish a ""communication mechanism."" She also said organizing the governing team to be talent and talent, regardless of the faction, would sincerely invite them to join the group. It seems that they want to enlist the pan-ordinary people into the cabinet.
These words are a bit deja vu and Lin Hsieh's going is a line of ""grand reconciliation"" with the Pan-people. She really did as I expected before the election. She was not ""CY2.0"" and was not politically more rigid against the central authorities route. She is a ""pro bono 呔 0.5"" and wants to walk the path of ""grand reconciliation"" that draws Pan-people together. However, under the objective environmental constraints, this road is more difficult than the ""Eradicated"" era.
It was not surprising for Lam Ching's popularity that I think her election campaign started very late and the popularity of the people lags behind Mr Tsang. The real question is whether she can gradually lift her popularity after she assumes office.
We can recall that the popularity of the three chief executive heads in the past is both higher and lower. Their high popularity early in their tenure, each with a cause. He was very fresh when he returned to his first chief executive. Hong Kong was the first Hong Kong Governor Governorate to be sent by the British. Therefore, he was originally from Guangzhou Tinci Materials Technology Co.,Ltd. People can not learn. In the late period of Dong Bu-bo, he was attacked by the pan-people attacks on the political grounds of Article 23 and was resentful on the economic livelihood for the collapse of SARS and property prices.
When the government took the liberty of the Central Government, Hong Kong's economy came out of the trough. Politically, it has hit the banner of ""reconciliation"" and popularity has risen. At the end of his administration, there was no major political event. However, property prices began to rise sharply. Coupled with the suspicion of collusion between officials and businessmen, the prices also dropped.
CY operated for two years before the 2012 election. It mainly landed at the grassroots level and advocated ""anti-property hegemony"" on economic and livelihood. Popularity gradually over rivals Tang and Tang, straight into the election. However, since CY came to power, it also shouldered the founding sin of the founding fathers. As a result, the popularity of the CY fell due to the fact that CY was relatively politically correct. However, his history of ""anti-property hegemony"" has caused some businesses not to support him. As a result, he failed to vote for the election again.
Looking back at the chief executive of the past, the tactics they used to steal popular support mainly consisted of two lines. If they were not aimed at economically fighting the hegemony of the consortia, they were politically close to the common people and alienating their God, When the ""anti-hegemony"" line goes too far, it will lose the ballot of consortia and the next election will be difficult to be re-elected. If ""Great Reconciliation"" is done too much, the political support from Lord Ah will be lost and the fate may be even worse. To be the chief executive grab the popular line of steel, walked a minute, fell to pieces.
If Lam is on the same path of reconciliation as she did on the other side of the road, she will face more limitations than she did. First, the rise of the dictatorship and radicalism will greatly constrain the motives of compromise between the Pan-Am and the chief executive. Pan-Pan-Afh will be afraid to reach an agreement on major political issues under the Chief Executive's pull line and will become a flawed injury to the next election and be attacked and snatched by radical groups.
Second, the rise of the dictatorship and radicals has also limited the scope for retreat from Ah Yeh. Take the previous four members of the DQ's second batch of incoming DQ members as an example. If the government wants to give up halfway through litigation and reconciliation with the Pan-Ummah, will the Lord agree? In the eyes of Aye, liberation of the dictatorship, they will not converge, or continue to snatch government power, and finally out of control.
Even if Lin Zheng wants to be a matchmaker, both parties do not want to make a fate, and in the end it is hard to become a good person. Of course, the desire to promote good reconciliation is worth encouraging. I also think that there is too much political noise in Hong Kong and it increasingly hates me.

I0460266045a511e79b049e41f956285c.1C,"七成英文词彙不是英文？根据统计，世界上最多人使用的母语是中文，超过十亿。排名第二的是英语，大概六亿人。如果加上第二语言使用人口，英语无疑是世界上应用最广泛语言，是真正的世界语。不过，你是否知道现代英语中，大部分词彙是舶来品，由其他语言传入？据二○一三年出版的《Words,
Meaning and
Vocabulary》一书估计，七成现今英文词彙是外来词，而博客Blog.dictionary.com更声称八成英文词彙由其他语言「借用」。具体数字的准确度我们一时无法确定，但大部分现代英文词彙由外语传入是不争的事实。如果我们「溯古寻源」，英文词彙发展大概分为四个阶段。第一阶段是古英文（Old
English）：古英文很有趣，没有大写字母，部分字母如j、v、x、z亦不存在，数字则使用罗马数字（如i、ii、iii、iv），文字串法（spelling）多变，一个词可以有几种不同写法；古英文中只有大约百分之三的外来词彙。第二阶段为中古英文（Middle
English）：特点是仍有一字多写法的问题，同时大量借用法文。英文中的猪、牛分别为pig、cow/ox，但猪肉、牛肉却是法文pork和beef，是这个阶段的舶来品。第三、第四阶段分别为近代英文（Early
Modern English）和现代英文（Modern
English）。这两个时期英文不再局限于借用欧洲语言，而是利用其殖民地的便利，大量借用全世界的语言，如curry、pajamas来自印度文；coffee、cotton来自阿拉伯文；karaoke、tsunami来自日文；tea、ketchup来自中文。大量借用欧洲及殖民地语言相对于英文词彙的开放程度，许多其他语言的态度就保守得多。法国过去长期抵制「英语入侵」，要求民众尽量不要在法语掺杂英文词彙，确保法语「纯洁」。去年，中国民政部清理「洋地名」，要求街道、居民区、楼房等不得冠以外国名字。然而，任何语言是「活」语言，不会一成不变，特别在互联网年代，要保持语言「纯洁」而抵制外来词彙，谈何容易？何况也不见得有此必要。二○一五年，法国文化部长Fleur
Pellerin表示，她改变法国对待英语的态度，欢迎英文「丰富」（enrich）法语词彙。香港广东话由于殖民地历史深受英文影响，许多日常用语都来自英文，譬如搭「
」（lift）、巴士（bus）等。普通民众通常不会留意外来词的性质，视其为广东话一部分。或者只有他们北上广州，听到当地人讲搭「电梯」、「公共汽车」的时候才会略有所思，会心一笑。注：小题为本报所加琤芮瑊z学院英文学系副教授

","Qicheng English vocabulary is not English? According to statistics, the largest number of native speakers in the world is Chinese, exceeding one billion. Ranked second in English, about 600 million people. If you add the second language to use the population, English is undoubtedly the most widely used language in the world, is a real Esperanto. However, do you know that in modern English most of the words are imported and imported from other languages? According to ""Words, published in 2013,
Meaning and
Vocabulary, a book estimates that 70% of today's English words are loanwords, while blog Blog.dictionary.com claims that 80% of English words are ""borrowed"" from other languages. The accuracy of the specific figures we can not be sure for some time, but most modern English words are imported from foreign languages ​​is an indisputable fact. If we look back on ancient sources, the development of English vocabulary is roughly divided into four stages. The first stage is Old English
English): Old English is very interesting, there is no capital letter, some letters do not exist such as j, v, x, z, numbers are Roman numerals (eg i, ii, iii, iv) , A word can be written in several different ways; in Old English only about 3% of foreign words. The second stage is Middle English
English): The problem is that there is still more than one word written at a time, borrowing heavily in French. English pigs, cow were pig, cow / ox, but pork, beef is French pork and beef, is the exotic goods at this stage. The third and fourth stages are Modern English respectively
Modern English and Modern English
English). Instead of borrowing European languages ​​in both periods, English is no longer limited to borrowing European languages; rather, it borrows the colony's conveniences to borrow large numbers of languages ​​from around the world, such as curry, pajamas from Hindi, coffee, cotton from Arabic, karaoke from tsunami, , Ketchup from Chinese. Borrowing in large numbers the openness of European and colonial languages ​​relative to the English vocabulary, many other languages ​​are much more conservative. In the past, France had boycotted ""English invasion"" for a long time, requiring the public to try not to confuse English words in French and ensure French ""purity."" Last year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs of China cleaned up ""foreign names"" and demanded that foreign names such as streets, residential areas and buildings should not be crowned. However, any language is a ""living"" language and will not be static. Especially in the Internet age, how easy it is to keep the language pure and resist foreign words? Not to mention this is not necessarily necessary. In 2015, French Culture Minister Fleur
Pellerin said she changed France's attitude towards English and welcomed the English ""enrich"" French vocabulary. Hong Kong Cantonese As the history of the colonies is deeply influenced by the English language, many everyday expressions come from English, such as ""
(Lift), bus (bus) and so on. Ordinary people generally do not pay attention to the nature of the loanwords and regard them as part of Cantonese. Or only if they go north to Guangzhou, they will only think a little while listening to the locals talking about ""lifts"" and ""buses.""

诡异的政治经济困局。虽然习近平表面上以集权反腐以预防及惩治党内的野心家，加强国家安全统摄国内稳定和对香港的控制。实际上，郭文贵和肖建华等顺藤摸瓜出来的事件折射出过去30年国家社会主义在资本主义转型中，进入权金与金权政治的勾结，
侵吞国家和民间资产，狡猾利用全球化资本流动链条进行操纵，躲避国家监控，把民脂民膏转移海外的困境。在回归20年、八九民运快30年之际，香港与国内整合加速。香港成为了国内红白黑资本的流通之地，以及权金和金钱政治的角力场所。结合香港既得利益精英的依附性和保守性，香港的资产管理中心、
超级联繫人角色等只会加剧对这种集权与贪腐权力共生体制的依赖。香港面对的困境愈来愈接近国内的政治经济困境，或许这就是未来与国内民主运动相应的基础。 求雾子

","People's Name and People Will Not Forget The trigger of the 1989 democracy movement lies in the dual-track system of planned prices and unplanned prices of planned economic reforms, highlighting the power rent-seeking activities of the second generation, intensifying social discontent with inflation and the society, Dominant questioning and democratization requirements. 30 years have passed, and privatization, marketization and globalization of national socialism have brought rampant corruption and misappropriation of state and private assets. What are the thoughts on the democratization process in China and Hong Kong caused by the political and economic difficulties reflected by the anti-corruption campaign of ""Xi Wang Ba Zi"" and Guo Wengui's struggle against the power hunter? In 2017, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in order to cooperate with the anti-corruption campaign of the Central Government, made a set of ""the name of the people"" of the largest anti-corruption drama since the founding of the People's Republic by the Chinese media. After the release of the drama, the social response was enthusiastic. Perhaps it was a voyeuristic middle-level political psychology as well as a verification of social gossip. The scale of the episode did not disappoint: the vice-state high-cadre families trailed behind the scenes. One province, from the secretary of the Politics and Law Committee, the director of the Public Security Bureau, the political and legal system, and the CEOs of state-owned enterprises, appeared to suffer from corruption. From personal bribery to big The scale of the embezzlement of state and private assets, from illegal eavesdropping, interference with the investigation, framing and hiring snipers to assassinate anti-Corruption Secretary of the plot have appeared. It is particularly interesting that the largest drama series since the founding of the People's Republic of China has been realistic. It is particularly interesting to highlight Hong Kong's political and economic position in the chain of corruption. Corrupt officials in Hong Kong Three Seasons Hotel North Building, long-term package of a room, what signs of trouble hid in Hong Kong. Wang North Building long-term accumulation of corrupt officials and employers in the country have troubled the officials, there is also a Cantonese accent, supernatural magazines editor for the cover of the golden right Kuaichu off; after collecting money he can create public opinion, Protect corrupt officials and employers, attack opponents, buy domestic relations, arrest people, and even kill people. Although the drama, but the author Zhou Mason use the information is approved by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, which means that the actual situation occurred. In his words, the actual corruption episode goes far beyond the writer's imagination. However, comparing Hong Kong and overseas are taking place, the uproar of the controversial Guo Wengui broke the news, Ma Jian, former vice minister of Ministry of Security confession of criminal facts, Xiao Jianhua at the Four Seasons Hotel was ""matched by investigation"" to return to China, Causeway Bay Bookstore Incident, Wang Lijun and Bo Xilai In the incident, Zhou Yongkang's operation of power and money, as well as his former director of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China insinuating that his brother who planned to flee to the United States ordered the detonation of a ""nuclear bomb"" to expose the stolen state secrets, ""the name of the people The problems reflected are only insignificant. Although Guowang Gui burst of material difficult to distinguish authenticity, Ma Jian confession of the crime is already shocking. Under Guo Wengui's bribe, the deputy minister of the State Security Department kept using the means and identities of the national security to investigate, tap, intervene and intimidate Guo Wengui's commercial and political rivals. Guowen Gui also carried a ""bigger than the sky,"" the old leader as a bargaining chip, I do not know if he and the completion of what other bombs to detonate. If Hong Kong's domestic power is more complicated than that of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, the fighting and fighting of 2017 King and the Wicked Tiger will be more complicated.
Strange political and economic difficulties. Although Xi Jinping ostensibly centralized and anti-corruption efforts to prevent and punish ambitious members of the Party, it has strengthened national stability and domestic control of Hong Kong. In fact, events such as Guo Wengui and Xiao Jianhua, which followed the example of Fujimori, reflected the collusion between state power and the gold rights politics in the past 30 years of state socialism's transformation to capitalism.
Embezzlement of state and private assets, the use of cunning use of the chain of global capital flows to manipulate, to avoid state control, the transfer of people's fat cream overseas plight. In the two decades since the reunification and the 30-year pro-democracy movement in 1989, Hong Kong has accelerated its integration with China. Hong Kong has become the place of circulation of the red and white capital in the country, as well as the battlefield of power and money politics. In line with the reliance and conservativeness of Hong Kong's vested interest in Elitegroup Computer Systems Co.,Ltd.,Hong Kong's asset management center,
The role of super contacts will only aggravate the dependence on such a symbiotic system of centralization and corruption. The dilemma facing Hong Kong is getting closer to the domestic political and economic difficulties. Perhaps this is the basis for the future corresponding to the domestic democratic movement.

your
Mind」的小组，推动课程改革，多读世界不同哲学家的思想。SOAS可算是伦敦大学之中，激进思想的泉源；所以，关于SOAS的哲学课程之中，应否继续多读西方哲学的内容，仍成为新闻焦点，笔者颇感意外。而英国保守报章犹如发现新大陆，勐闹老师学生数典忘祖，读哲学不读柏拉图，可恶也。但是，英国读者大抵都是标题党，如果不去深入理解这小组的倡议，其实也犯下人批我批的毛病。该小组的倡议很简单，读哲学要有批判思考，别被Enlightenment的哲学思想困住自身。换言之，阅读世界不同哲学体系，让学生更广阔去理解不同哲学流派的讨论，从而有新角度去切入及批判现时欧洲的哲学关怀。从这角度看，外界委实毋须大惊小怪，这也是笔者母校独特的学风。「去殖化」素来是SOAS的教育特色。以「国际人权法」为例，其他大学的相关课程是阅读英国人权法以至欧洲及联合国的人权法桉例；笔者母校课程却是「发展中国家的人权法」，读的是肯尼亚、坦桑尼亚、南非、加勒比海岛国等国家的人权法及实施状况。学生理解的是，在去殖化之后，新独立国家即使有人权法条文，人权实施仍是惨不忍睹。至于「国际环境保护法」，其他大学的相关课程就会多读国际法条文及欧洲等国的条文及桉例，SOAS的却是一大堆第三世界国家如何被支离破碎以及向西方大国倾钭的环境保护法所牺牲。又例如《比较宪法》一科，就是研究第三世界国家在去殖独立后的宪法条文及人权保障。另一些跨学科例如《去殖化与经济发展》，就是研究英国二战后的去殖化政策与帝国如何推动殖民地的经济发展。基本上，笔者当年读书时，有一半以上的学科，就是读去殖化。这可算是SOAS学术特色，可以说是DNA。换句话说，任何学科经过笔者母校学者们「把玩一番」后，就必然会「去欧洲中心化」，即係不再用欧美主流论述去教学或研究，必然就会有欧洲以外的声音存在。哲学科经过「去殖化」，自然就会挑战欧洲哲学的主流声音，多些探讨非欧洲的哲学讨论。当然，看官大可以说，英语世界的讨论及关怀，已经因为语言的隔阂，对欧陆哲学的相关理解已经打了八折，如果又用英语去阅读中国及印度哲学，会否又係打了五折？至于例如后殖民理论，即使例如Franz
Fannon，其背后都是有关帝国及殖民主义的讨论，都是欧洲理论的反动，如果不先理解欧洲中心的哲学，又如何去欧洲中心呢？哲学的终极关怀，经过几千年的讨论，来来去去都係先从道德、宗教及思考方法等大方向出发，其实也毋须刻意地夸大「去中心化」这个说法。欧洲哲学，特别是欧陆哲学处理的是现代性的问题，大抵可以勉强地说是欧洲以至美帝等国家知识分子关心的当下议题，却未必代表了非洲小国人民当下关心的议题。这里没有谁对谁错、孰优孰劣的问题。学术的讨论就是要不断挑战及跨越（Transgression），或者母校学者关于思维去殖化的讨论，有助扩阔青年学生对现代社会的想像，这样更毋须大惊小怪。思想去殖，总比盲目恋英好。王慧麟

","Ideological dehumanizing than blind love good British media reported once the author ─ ─ University of London School of Asia and Africa (SOAS), most will not be a good thing. Recently, SOAS often reported that while students and teachers had a sense of philosophical course too much of Eurocentrism, they engaged in a ""Decolonsing
your
Mind ""group to promote curriculum reform and read more of the world's different philosophers. SOAS can be considered as a source of radical thinking in the University of London. Therefore, I still find myself in the spotlight of whether or not to read more about western philosophy in the SOAS philosophical course. The British conservative newspaper found that if Fujian Newland Computer Co.,Ltd.,Mongolian teacher students forget the ancestor, reading philosophy is not Plato, damn also. However, the British readers are probably the title parties. Without a thorough understanding of this group's initiative, they actually committed the criticism from the people. The group's initiative is simple, read the philosophy of critical thinking, do not be trapped by Enlightenment's philosophical thought itself. In other words, reading different philosophical systems in the world gives students a broader understanding of the discussions among different philosophical schools so that they can have a new perspective in cutting and criticizing the current philosophical concern in Europe. From this perspective, the outside world really need not make a fuss, this is my unique style of study alma mater. ""Demolition"" has long been a SOAS educational feature. Taking ""International Human Rights Law"" as an example, the relevant courses in other universities are eamples of human rights law that read English human rights law as well as Europe and the United Nations. The author's alma mater is entitled ""Human Rights Law in Developing Countries"" and reads ""Kenya's, Tanzanian, South Africa, the Caribbean island countries and other countries of the human rights law and the status of implementation. Students understand that, even after the de-colonization, the newly independent state has human rights law provisions, and human rights implementation will still be appalling. As for the ""International Environmental Protection Law,"" relevant courses in other universities read more articles on international law and other European countries. SOAS, however, is how a large number of Third World countries have been fragmented and turned to western powers Environmental protection law sacrifices. Another example is the ""comparative constitution"" of a subject, that is, to study the constitutional provisions and human rights protection of third world countries after their independence. Other interdisciplinary studies such as ""Decolonization and Economic Development"" study the post-World War II democratization policy in the United Kingdom and how the empire promotes the colonial economic development. Basically, when I was studying in that year, more than half of the subjects were demobilization. This can be regarded as SOAS academic features, it can be said that DNA. In other words, after any subject is ""played"" by its author alchemist, it will inevitably ""go to Europe."" If it is no longer taught or studied in Europe and the United States, there will inevitably be voices outside Europe . After the ""discipline"" of philosophy, it will naturally challenge the mainstream voice of European philosophy, and more will discuss non-European philosophical discussions. Of course, Tell Mentor can say that the discussion and concern in the English-speaking world have already lost 20% of the relevant understanding of the European philosophy because of the language barrier. If we read the Chinese and Indian philosophy in English again, will we again fight it? 50% off? As for postcolonial theory, for example, even Franz
Fannon, whose discussion behind the empire and colonialism are all reactionary to the European theory, did not go to the European center without first understanding the philosophy of the European Center? After thousands of years of discussion and discussion, the ultimate concern of philosophy is that starting from the general directions of morality, religion and method of thinking, in fact, there is no need to deliberately exaggerate the notion of ""decentralization."" European philosophy, especially Europhilosophy, deals with the problem of modernity. It can hardly be said that the current issues of concern to the intellectuals in Europe and the United States and the United States, but it does not necessarily represent the immediate concern of the small-scale people in Africa. There is no question of who is right or who is wrong. Academic discussion is to constantly challenge and transgression, or alchemist discussion on the issue of democratization of thinking, will help broaden young students to imagine modern society, so no more fuss. Democratization, better than blind love. Wang Hui Lin

In order to resume trading, ""Alternatives fly"" actually talked about and talked about before the launch of Chun-Jie, are generally follow the practice of creating a child, but when the SFC started to rectify, because Bloomberg had issued a document at the end of last year, referring to the world's 20 first day Ascent shares, Hong Kong a generation of 18, but unfortunately plunged, described Hong Kong as ""plunge all the capital."" As soon as the article was reported, the negative image of Hong Kong stock market has entered the international perspective. However, the first day of Chun Jie listing, indeed the Department of approved retail investors into the market, no la la hanged suspended half day, the resumption of conditions Department to issue new shares to meet the requirements of the Securities and Futures Commission sources, even if there is no violation, but with small investors with individual investors Do not be fair. Di Fan Central clearing data show Junjie listed brokerage had only 13, but went to last Friday, suddenly changed 83, including the tide of securities with the two securities of the good securities no shadow; and managers Pacific Foundation, distributors Zhong Chen Securities, and President Securities Corp.'s holdings, overnight rally. Shares broke up to 72 new brokerage firms, many of whom are active in the GEM brokerage firms, such as Koala, Ding Cheng, Beagle and SHAN DONG SUN PAPER INDUSTRY JOINT STOCK CO.,LTD. International. Then look carefully Di, there are 21 lines hold only one hand (4000 shares), one of the securities more than enough to hold the 3100 shares. Seeing it a position, Ah Man could not bear to smile. The so-called generous in line with the requirements of the Commission to increase the public stake, microphone and surface effort, but the Department of ""alternative to fly,"" Jun Jie positions more dispersed, the purpose of seeking only the resumption of trading. In fact, the SFC alone refers to the Securities and Futures Ordinance, Section 8.1, which orders the appearance of Junjie Red Card. The Eucalyptus has been raised to the level of the Board of Directors of the SFC and must be resolved by law. As for the board of directors, I think it is as if a single player is playing a big part this afternoon. Therefore, after all, a series of superficial efforts will be made to implement the deal, so that both parties will eventually regret it. However, after a battle of Junjie, whether it is a creation of a motherboard, it is not heard during this period that some people have enough courage to ""engage in""嗰 class public relations, really busy with a cigarette, all because of the helper to sell out, do a good job road shows, etc.,before you agree 搞 simple net system intimidation conference to engage.

","In the short term, the WCR heavyweight project will bid 35 on the Jincheng Road Station
China-Hong Kong consortia fought over competing railroad cover project for this year's land supply base, the first launch of the West Rail Kam Sheung Road Station Intercept intention yesterday, shutting up 35 letters of intent, is the railway cover project has always been the second largest The ""land war"" kicked off. Intention to diversify the consortium, in addition to the large-scale developers in Hong Kong, there are also a number of Chinese-funded conspiracy to compete. Market participants pointed out that the land is suitable for medium and low-density luxury buildings with an investment of more than 10 billion yuan. Kam Sheung Road Station Phase 1 is the first West Rail project launched in nearly two years. The project is now an open-air parking lot with a rectangular area and is quite easy to cut. Coupled with the considerable scale of development, it will help to reduce the cost per square foot The development cost of the project was extremely beneficial. The project cut intentions yesterday and immediately set off a number of consortia for competition. A spokesman for the MTRCL said that the project received a total of 35 letters of intent and it will compile a list of the shortlisted bidders to invite the developers or The consortium submitted the formal bidding documents and launched the tender invitation as soon as possible. The number of intentions submitted was quite satisfactory. The number of prospectuses searched for and recorded was the second most frequent MTR project in Hong Kong. It was 39% after the first phase of Wong Chuk Hang Station Phase 1 project in January this year Letter of intent Suitable for medium and low density luxury into the intention of the consortium quite diversified, large developers include Cheung Kong, New World, Shinsegae B letter and WHEELOCK AND COMPANY LIMITED, Ka Wah, Nan Fung, and Chinachem; For small and medium-sized developers, including Road King Infrastructure, which previously won the Wong Chuk Hang Station Phase 1 project as a joint venture. Other consortiums include Emperor International Holdings Limited, FAR EAST CONSORTIUM INTERNATIONAL LIMITED, Regal International, The Empire Group, Asia Standard International Group Limited, John Chuang, Hao Jian, Hong An, and Java Holdings. In addition, the project also attracted a minimum of 5 domestic housing consortium bidders, including China Overseas, Yuexiu Property Company Limited, China Resources Land, Java Holdings, CHINA VANKE CO.,LTD. Property (Hong Kong), and LOGAN PROPERTY HOLDINGS COMPANY LIMITED, Intention to consortia over 14%, we can see that the consortium consortia have a high regard for quality land. Intention to diversify the type of consortium Emperor International Holdings Limited Liu Chaoqun, senior property director, said the supply of rail cover project rare, coupled with the facilities of convenience; reference Yuen Long and Hong Shui Qiaokong new disk sales ideal, plus the New Territories West Development potential, optimistic about the project prospects. Zhang Shengdian, director of the Valuation Department of Ideal City, said that the project is becoming more and more mature in the same district, with the railway station as the biggest selling point. However, the Tai Lam Tunnel and the Western Corridor also add more points to the transport network, which means: ""I am a developer Will fight it a type
project"". However, he added that although the project is considered to have great potential for development, the package of livelihood needs to be further strengthened. With over 10 billion investment amount, Lam Hau Man, a senior director of Knight Frank and head of valuation and consulting department, said that due to the large scale of project development, it is estimated that the land cost will exceed $ 10 billion for construction cost. I believe that with the exception of the large-scale developer with abundant funds, Developers who are interested in bidding will bid for the group consortium to share the development risk. It is learned that no less than 1652 units will be provided, of which about 661 units should be no more than 531 square feet in area, accounting for about 40% of the total. The ratio is the smallest since the West Rail project has the relevant restrictions.

持续横行新年后表现一直稳定的A股，昨天迎来轻微回调，沪指及深成指分别下跌0.3%及0.25%。此前表现突出的军工及基建股出现回吐，成为拖低大市的主要原因。不过，资源类股份接力上升，国企改革概念炒作则转至航空股。两市成交金额合共4174亿元人民币，与周一相若，目前市场动力仍稍嫌不足，春节前或会持续横行格局。沪指昨天收报3161点，跌不足10点。煤炭、钢铁、商业百货为表现最突出的三个板块，升幅分别为0.99%、0.97%及0.8%。惟此前表现最佳的军工相关飞机製造及船舶製造则成为表现最差的板块，分别下跌1.93%及1.44%。国家统计局昨天公布，去年12月全国居民消费价格指数（CPI）按年上涨2.1%，比11月回落0.2个百分点；工业生产者出厂价格指数（PPI）按年上扬5.5%，升幅比11月扩大2.2个百分点。PPI涨幅扩大，主要受包括黑色金属冶炼、石油加工、化学原料及化学製品等行业，製造业价格按月上涨幅度扩大所带动。大宗商品价格上涨，则推动了部分工业品出厂价格。市场需求稳定增长，去产能、去库存政策效果显现，令整体供需关係逐步改善。经济好转
惠及商品股中信证券发表报告，唱好内地经济的复甦。报告指出，2016年工业企业产成品存货累计按年连续7个月负增长，显示存货「去化」已经接近尾声，预计2017年上半年（最晚下半年），中国存货将开始逐渐进入补库存阶段。市场需求上升，对大宗商品有利。受经济数据向好带动，商品期货价格昨天普遍造好，其中，焦炭升9%、铁矿石升8%。煤炭、钢铁板块亦受惠而大升，方大特钢（600507.SH）升6%、太钢不鏽（000825.SZ）弹5.2%、鞍钢（000898.SZ）涨4.8%、冀中能源（000937.SZ）上扬4.3%、西山煤电（000983.SZ）及潞安环能（601699.SH）抽高2.4%。另外，发改委昨天举行记者会，指中国当前产业结构在不断优化，前三季度服务业增加值佔比已经上升到52.8%，比第二产业高出13.3个百分点。消费对经济的贡献率已经达到71%，比上年同期提高了13个百分点。去年一、二、三季度的GDP增速都是6.7%，预计全年亦可维持6.7%左右的增幅。未来几年，消费市场可望迎来更广阔的增长空间，零售股前景惹人憧憬。近年，零售行业一直受网购打击，但最近一段时间，两者由竞争变为合作，令市场发展进入新格局。阿里巴巴昨天刚好提出私有化银泰商业（01833），亦为内地零售股带来提振。憧憬改革
航空炒落后事实上，自从2014年3月，阿里入股银泰商后，双方联手推出了多项网上网下（O2O）融合的产品。市场憧憬私有化银泰后，可望推动网下新零售行业的发展。商业百货股昨天表现突出，茂业通信（000889.SZ）、杭州解百（600814.SH）及红旗连锁（002697.SZ）涨停。最近一段时间，国企改革概念一直是市场热炒的话题。军工改革股炒了数天后，投资者将目标转到股价较为落后的航空股。其中，南方航空（600029.SH）大升7.4%、国航（601111.SH）涨3%。目前，国企改革相关的落后股份仍不少，值得投资者好好发掘。踏入2017年以来，经过短短6个交易日，沪指及深成指分别上升1.87%及1.27%。目前，市场投资气氛虽然趋于乐观，但在入市资金不足的情况下，市场升势亦难免受限。相信在春节前，沪指或会维持在3100点至3200点之间窄幅上落，大致保持横行。待春节假期后，升势才会重现。

","Lack of motivation
The continuous correction of the A-shares, which have been stable after the New Year, ushered in a slight correction yesterday. The Shanghai Composite Index and the Shenzhen Component Index fell 0.3% and 0.25% respectively. Military and infrastructure stocks, which had been prominent before, took a vomit and became the main reason for dragging down the broader market. However, the relay of resources stocks rose and the speculation of state-owned enterprise reform went to aviation stocks. The total transaction volume between the two cities totaled 417.4 billion yuan, similar to that on Monday. At present, the market momentum is still somewhat underestimated, and may continue to ramp up before the Spring Festival. Stock index closed at 3161 points yesterday, fell less than 10 points. Coal, steel and commercial department store were the three most prominent sectors, up 0.99%, 0.97% and 0.8% respectively. However, the best-performing military-related aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding were among the worst performing sectors after declining 1.93% and 1.44% respectively. National Bureau of Statistics yesterday announced that in December last year, the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.1% year-on-year, down 0.2 percentage points from November; the producer price index (PPI) of industrial producers rose 5.5% year-on-year, Expand by 2.2 percentage points. The increase in PPI expanded mainly driven by sectors such as ferrous metal smelting, petroleum processing, chemical raw materials and chemical products, and the price of manufacturing industry increased month by month. The rise of commodity prices pushed up the ex-factory prices of some industrial products. The steady growth in market demand, the effectiveness of de-capacity and de-stocking policies have brought about an overall improvement in the overall supply and demand. The economy improves
Benefiting from the publication of a report by CITIC Securities Company Limited, the commodities unit praised the economic recovery in the Mainland. The report pointed out that in 2016, industrial enterprises' inventories of finished products accumulated a negative growth of 7 consecutive months in a row for the first time in a row, indicating that the ""destocking"" of inventories is drawing to a close. It is estimated that in the first half of 2017 (latest second half), Chinese inventories will gradually enter the replenishment period . Market demand is rising, favorable for commodities. Driven by economic data, commodity futures prices were generally good yesterday, with coke up 9% and iron ore up 8%. Coal, steel and other metals sectors also benefited from the rise. Fangda Steel (600507.SH) rose 6%, Taigang Stainless (000825.SZ) bounced 5.2% and Angang Steel Company Limited (000898.SZ) gained 4.8% Shanxi Xishan Coal and Electricity Power Co.,Ltd. (000983.SZ) and Shanxi Lu'an Environmental Energy Development Co.,Ltd. (601699.SH) surged 4.3% after Jizhong Energy Resources Co.,Ltd. (000937.SZ) ) Pumping high 2.4%. In addition, the NDRC held a press conference yesterday, referring to the ongoing optimization of China's industrial structure. The value added of the service industry in the first three quarters has risen to 52.8%, 13.3 percentage points higher than the secondary industry. The contribution rate of consumption to the economy has reached 71%, an increase of 13% over the same period of last year. In the first, second and third quarters, the GDP growth rate was 6.7%. It is also expected that the annual growth rate will be maintained at around 6.7% for the whole year. In the next few years, the consumer market is expected to usher in a broader space for growth. The outlook for the retail sector is very promising. In recent years, the retail industry has been hit by online shopping. However, in the recent period, both have shifted from competition to cooperation and the market has entered a new pattern. Alibaba yesterday just privatized Intime Commercial (01833), which also boosted the mainland retail sector. Looking forward to reform
In fact, since March 2014, Ali shares Yintai business, the two sides jointly launched a number of online and offline (O2O) convergence of products. The market is looking forward to privatization Intime, is expected to promote the development of the new retail industry under the net. Commercial department store stocks outstanding yesterday, MAOYE INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED communications (000889.SZ), Hangzhou Jie hundred (600814.SH) and the red flag chain (002697.SZ) daily limit. Recently, the concept of state-owned enterprise reform has been a hot topic in the market. A few days after the military reform stocks fired, investors shifted their targets to the more underperforming aviation stocks. Among them, China Southern Airlines Company Limited (600029.SH) soared 7.4%, Air China (601111.SH) rose 3%. At present, there are still many behind-the-back shares related to the reform of state-owned enterprises, which should be well explored by investors. Since entering 2017, after only 6 trading days, the Shanghai Composite Index and the Shenzhen Component Index gained 1.87% and 1.27% respectively. At present, although the market investment climate tends to be optimistic, the market rally will inevitably be limited in the absence of sufficient capital. I believe before the Spring Festival, stock index may be maintained at a narrow range between 3100 and 3200 points, generally remain rampant. After the Spring Festival holiday, the upward trend will be repeated.",动力不足 持续横行,Not Reuters,01:14PM 13 Sep 2017,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I064d38b0d76d11e6b609d408e2914ecc.1C.html

刘育英）中国垄断行业溷合所有制改革打响第一枪。中国联合网络通信集团有限公司（简称中国联通）5日夜间发布公告，该公司正在筹划并推进开展与溷合所有制改革相关的重大事项。中国企业改革与发展研究会副会长李锦接受中新社采访时称，目前大部分央企改革的重点放在资本证券化和公司上市方面，一些企业的溷改工作是悄悄进行的。“中国联通掀起了垄断行业溷改的新风。”5日临时停牌的中国联通港股6日恢复交易，盘初大涨逾3%，创2015年7月以来新高。2015年9月，中国官方发布《关于国有企业发展溷合所有制经济的意见》，提出将在电力、石油、天然气、铁路、民航、电信、军工等领域改革，开展放开竞争性业务、推进溷合所有制改革试点示范。2016年9月，国家发改委召开国有企业溷合所有制改革试点专题会，将东航集团、联通集团、南方电网等中央企业列入第一批试点的溷合所有制改革项目。中国联通在首批试点企业中第一个宣布正在进行溷改的消息。对于本来就是改革产物的中国联通而言，此次溷合所有制改革具有重要意义。2016年，中国联通交出上市以来最差成绩单，净利润仅6.3亿元（人民币，下同），同比下降94.1%。在互联网和移动互联网冲击下，传统电信业收入和利润增速放缓。同时，与市场化的互联网公司相比，整个电信行业都面临机制僵化的制约。溷合所有制改革或将改善中国联通的投资状况。2016年，中国联通资本开支大幅下降，仅为人民币721亿元，同比下降46%。通信网络是重资产，需要大规模先期投资。中国联通仍需要大量资本实施4G网络优化、宽带网络光纤化改造以及未来的5G投资，也需要通过扩大用户规模降低单位成本来支持提速降费。在国资控股前提下，实施股权多元化改造，有利于改善联通目前的经营困境。在业务层面，引入新的投资者也有望扩大联通在产业链上下游的影响力，进而提升盈利能力。中国三大互联网公司此前均与中国联通达成了战略合作。据互联网业内分析，腾讯、阿里巴巴的业务和联通的主营业务有很好的互补性，深入合作将提升各自的效益，实现共赢，同时对联通的业绩会有明显促进，带来资产价值的提升，实现国有资产保值增值的目标；尽管百度核心业务与联通的互补性不强，但未来百度人工智能方面需要依托5G网络，因此与联通合作也势在必行。中国联通总经理陆益民此前表示，电信领域要深化溷合所有制改革，相信这一举措将进一步激发电信企业的内生动力与企业活力，加快行业创新转型，进一步做强做大做优国有企业。联通内部人士表示，希望“溷改”能够打破老国企大锅饭和论资排辈的弊端，引入市场化机制，干部能上能下、员工多劳多得，并且回报不受岗级限制、不再是铁饭碗，实行末位淘汰。（完）

","(Economic Observer) Monopoly industry in China changed the first shot hit China News Agency Beijing, April 6 (Reporter Liu Chen Yao
Liu Yuying) China's monopolistic industry started the first shot with the reform of ownership. China United Network Communications Group Co.,Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as China United Network Communications Limited) issued a notice on the evening of the 5th. The company is planning and promoting the major issues related to the reform of the joint ownership system. Li Jin, vice president of China's Enterprise Reform and Development Research Association, told China News Agency interview that at present most of the reform of central state-owned enterprises focuses on the issue of capital securities and the listing of companies. Some enterprises' reform work is quietly carried out. ""China United Network Communications Limited set off a fresh rebound in monopoly industries."" China United Network Communications Limited, the Hong Kong stock exchange temporarily suspended on the 5th, resumed trading on the 6th and rose more than 3% in early trade to a new high since July 2015. In September 2015, China officially released the Opinions on Developing State-owned Economy by Ownership System and proposed that it should reform its fields of power, oil, natural gas, railways, civil aviation, telecommunications and military industry to liberalize its competitive businesses and promote Joint ownership reform pilot demonstration. In September 2016, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) held a pilot symposium on the reform of state-owned enterprises under the ownership of ownership system. Central enterprises such as CEA Group, Unicom Group and China Southern Power Grid were included in the first pilot reform of the combined ownership reform project. China United Network Communications Limited was the first among the first pilots to announce the ongoing rectification. For China United Network Communications Limited, which was originally a product of reform, the reform of joint ownership is of great significance. In 2016, China United Network Communications Limited, the worst transcript since its listing, posted a net profit of only Rmb630m, down 94.1% YoY. Under the impact of the Internet and mobile Internet, revenue and profit growth of the traditional telecommunications industry slowed down. At the same time, the entire telecom industry is constrained by the rigidities of the mechanisms compared to market-based internet companies. Joint ownership reform may improve the investment performance of China United Network Communications Limited. In 2016, the capital expenditures of China United Network Communications Limited dropped significantly, reaching only RMB72.1 billion, a decrease of 46% over the same period of previous year. Communication networks are heavy assets, requiring large-scale upfront investments. China United Network Communications Limited still needs a lot of capital to implement 4G network optimization, broadband network fiberization transformation and future 5G investment. It also needs to speed up and down the cost by expanding user scale and reducing unit cost. In the premise of state-owned assets, the implementation of equity diversification, is conducive to improving the current business dilemma of China Unicom. At the business level, the introduction of new investors is also expected to expand the influence of China Unicom in the upstream and downstream industries, thereby enhancing profitability. China's three major Internet companies have previously reached a strategic cooperation with China United Network Communications Limited. According to the Internet industry analysis, Tencent Holdings Limited, Alibaba's business and China Unicom's main business are very complementary, in-depth cooperation will enhance their respective benefits and achieve win-win situation, while the performance of China Unicom will be significantly promoted, brought Although the core business of Baidu and China Unicom are not very complementary to each other, in the future, Baidu's artificial intelligence needs to rely on the 5G network.

of
Concept，POC）的阶段，逐步落实更多商业应用。安心食品电商「奥丁丁市集」创办人王俊凯，便看准了此机遇，将区块链技术结合至旗下的奥丁丁市集，推出奥丁丁区块链溯源系统「OwlChain」，将区块链运用于食品生产追溯，以防业者造假、修改的可能性。据悉，将有台农发公司、新芳园酱油、明全牧场、池上禾穀坊、有心肉铺子等不同业者加入。揭露产销流程各环节王俊凯表示，开放不同种类的生产者、原料进出口商、物流业者等加入，合作构建开放式区块链溯源系统，针对产品特殊性，揭露产销流程各环节的资讯，有助向大众推广优良厂商，而用家亦得以安心购入优质食材，可谓双赢。近年，食物安全已成为全民关注的议题，无论是民间或政府机关，皆推出生产履历，以证明及控管食物品质。而王俊凯与许多父母一样，十分注重子女的饮食，一心想给孩子最好的。「只想给小孩喝最天然的鲜奶、最健康的食物」因而成为他创业的动力，创立了奥丁丁电商平台，汇众台湾当地多家优质厂商与小农家。为提升台湾的食物安全环境，王俊凯决定进一步区块链技术，引入食品溯源系统，与台湾食品产业伙伴「祥圃集团」，及「涌升海洋」等优质厂商合作，根据不同食品产销流程，建立资讯公开透明、无可窜改，以及更具安全性的食品溯源系统「OwlChain」。事实上，出身硅谷的王俊凯早已利用科技改革食材採购体验，例如台湾鲜奶地图、水果地图等画面结合地图，让消费者产地的地理位置一目瞭然，更可在地图上按一键购买；为了快速回应用户问题，更在facebook粉丝团开发人工智能聊天机器人。至于支付方式，奥丁丁也第一时间启用Apple
Pay指纹支付，可在2秒内完成结帐；2014年起更和MaiCoin合作，成为接受比特币支付的电商平台。提高海洋环保标章可信度王俊凯决定将过去投资区块链公司的经验，应用到奥丁丁，并出以AMIS帐联网公司，用以太坊Ethereum的区块链技术，产生食品生产履历的概念。以合作伙伴涌升海洋为例，为了实践永续水产理念，涌升海洋建立了「责任渔业指标RFI」。那是个包括捕捞与养殖的海鲜追溯，与及环境冲击评估的机制，也可以说是一种海洋环保标章。涌升海洋有感于世界虽然有许多国际的海洋环保标章，但那些标章都是以服务大型及国际贸易导向海鲜的机制，对于以本地销售为主，且小型多样化的台湾并不适用。海洋环保标章由于其属性特殊，故多由民间而非政府推动，因此涌升海洋利用本身长期在台湾渔业研发、教育、管理、捕捞、养殖、加工、运销多项领域的经验，经过多年的思考及调整，发展出此套不仅适用于台湾近海海洋永续利用的标章，也适合世界许多以本地捕获销售为主的小型海洋经济体系。该系统可以评估水产永续性，并改善目前IUU（非法、未申报、没有规范）的渔业生产方式，由消费者在食用海鲜时产生的经济力量，达到兼顾美味、安全和环境责任的正面循环。涌升海洋创办人徐承堉表示：「依联合国统计，77%全球海洋渔业资源，已经饱和或过度开发。近年，台湾人愈来愈重视海鲜的
生安全，及生产过程对资源的冲击。我们希望将这个重视永续的观念，转变为行动力量。而区块链技术，具备不可窜改、可追溯的特性，能赋予海洋环保标章更高可信度，不但可以促进台湾渔业的永续利用，更可以将这个观念，与世界绝大多数地产地销的水产业分享。」

OwlChain, the food blockchain traceability system for relief food products, has been widely used in the blockchain market by incorporating the technology into its Odintin Market and introducing the Odintin area OwlChain, a blockchain traceability system, is used for traceability of food production to prevent the possibility of counterfeiting and modification by the manufacturer. Blockchain technology is one of the hottest FinTechs in recent years. In fact, in addition to the financial industry, blockchain can still be applied in other fields. Blockchain technology matures, and get rid of the POC (Proof
of
Concept, POC) stage, and gradually implement more commercial applications. After finding out about this opportunity, Wang Junkai, founder of Odin's Dinosaur Market, relied on the opportunity to integrate blockchain technology into its Austin Bazaar and launched the ""OwlChain"" Odintin blockchain system, Chain used in the traceability of food production, to prevent fraud, the possibility of modification. It is reported that there will be Taiwan's agricultural development company, the new Fangyuan soy sauce, the whole pasture, Ikegami Chi Square, a heart shop and other businesses to join. Wang Junkai revealed various links in the production and marketing process: Opening up different types of producers, importers and exporters of raw materials, and logistics operators to join and cooperate in building an open blockchain traceability system will help to identify the particularities of products and expose information on all aspects of the production and marketing processes Promote excellent manufacturers to the public, but users have also been able to buy high-quality ingredients at ease, can be described as a win-win situation. In recent years, food safety has become a topic of public concern. Both private and government agencies have introduced production records to prove and control food quality. And Wang Junkai, like many parents, attaches great importance to children's diet, bent on giving children the best. ""I just wanted to give my child the most natural milk and the healthiest food"" and thus became the driving force for his start-up. He founded the Odintin e-commerce platform and a number of local quality manufacturers and small farmers in Huitong Taiwan. In order to enhance the food safety environment in Taiwan, Wang Junkai decided to further blockchain technology by introducing a food traceability system and cooperating with quality food manufacturers such as ""Cheung Pu Group"" and ""Rising Ocean"". According to different food production and marketing processes, Wang Junkai established Open and transparent information, no tampering, and a more secure food tracking system, OwlChain. In fact, Wang Junkai from Silicon Valley has already used technology to reform the purchasing experience of ingredients. For example, the map of milk in Taiwan, fruit maps and other maps combined with the map make the geographical location of consumers at a glance, and can be purchased on the map by a key; In response to user questions, but also in the development of Facebook fans artificial intelligence chat robot. As for the payment method, Odin Ding also enabled Apple for the first time
Pay fingerprinting can be completed within 2 seconds checkout; 2014 even more and MaiCoin cooperation, to accept bitcoin payment e-commerce platform. Raise the credibility of the marine environmental protection mark Wang Junkai decided to invest his experience in investing in blockchain companies into Odintin and to create an idea of ​​food production using the blockchain technology of Ethereum from AMIS Network. In the case of a partner rising up the ocean, in order to implement the concept of perpetual aquaculture, the ocean surged up to establish a ""responsible fisheries index RFI."" It is a mechanism for the tracing and verification of seafood trawled and harvested, as well as environmental impact assessment. It can also be said to be a marine environmental protection mark. The Rising Ocean Feel the World Although there are many international marine environmental protection badges, those are all mechanisms that serve large-scale and international trade-oriented seafood and do not apply to small and diversified Taiwanese, which are mainly local in sales . Because of its special nature, marine environmental badges are often promoted by the private sector rather than the government. Therefore, the marine environmental protection standard has been used for many years in the field of fisheries research and development, education, management, fishing, breeding, processing, transportation and marketing in Taiwan. To think and adjust this set of standards not only for the sustainable use of Taiwan's offshore oceans but also for many of the world's small-scale ocean-based economic systems that capture and sell locally. The system can assess the sustainability of aquaculture and improve the current IUU (illegal, undeclared, non-normative) methods of fishery production that generate a positive balance of taste, safety and environmental responsibility from the economic power consumers consume when consuming seafood . Ascending Ocean founder Xu Cheng-chun said: ""According to UN statistics, 77% of the world's marine fishery resources have been saturated or over-exploited. In recent years, Taiwanese have paid increasing attention to seafood
Health and safety, and the impact of the production process on resources. We hope this transformative concept of sustainability will be transformed into a force of action. The blockchain technology, which can not be tampered with and traceability, can give marine environmental protection labels a higher level of credibility and can not only promote the sustainable use of Taiwan's fisheries, but also integrate this concept with the vast majority of real estate in the world Pin fisheries share.

Lin Chun-yin) The first logistics center in Fujian that integrates maritime express mail and cross-border electricity supplier bonded stocking and direct mail shopping and monitoring functions - the Express Mail Center across the Taiwan Strait. On May 9, at the Jingtan Cross-border Electricity Center in Pingtan Comprehensive Experimental Zone in Fujian Province, Business Logistics Park opened, has attracted more than 140 electricity providers, logistics and other enterprises settled. This is another vivid practice of Pingtan in accelerating the construction of a ""common homeland for both sides of the Taiwan Strait"" and promoting the integration and development of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Lin Wenyao, director of Pingtan Experimental Zone Committee, said in a recent interview that the vision of ""common homeland for both sides of the Taiwan Strait"" is becoming a reality one by one. Building ""the common homeland between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait"" is one of the three strategic tasks of Pingtan. In the past 6 years since the establishment of the comprehensive experimental zone, Pingtan upholds the concept of ""one kin and one benevolent"" and has stepped up exchanges and cooperation with Taiwan in economic, cultural and social fields to promote cross-Strait integration and benefit the people on both sides of the Strait. A Taiwanese community cultural plaza invested by Taiwanese-funded enterprises has been capped at Pingtan and is expected to be put into operation next March. The project covers an area of ​​35 acres, a total investment of 600000000 yuan (RMB, the same below), with the Taiwan compatriots community, the corridor of historical evolution, Areca nut, aboriginal performing arts district and other seven function blocks, will Pingtan Taiwan elements even more Outlined. Looking at the cross-Strait interactions in recent years, Lin Wen-yao used ""five more"" to describe things like closer contacts, closer cooperation, more open-mindedness, deeper feelings and a more solid foundation. The specific performance is that Pingtan has opened up a convenient channel for cross-Strait exchanges and the total number of cross-Strait passengers has exceeded 550,000 and crossed the Taiwan Strait. Pingtan took the lead in recognizing Taiwan's qualifications in the fields of tourism, construction, planning, medical care, and medical equipment. A group of practitioners in Taiwan took the floor. The Commonwealth Forum, the Taiwan Food Festival, the International Sand Drifting Festival and the cross-Strait marathon. All the people from all walks of life in the two sides of the strait actively participate in the exchange activities and staged a carnival of grassroots people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits every year. In Taiwan, Taiwan duty-free goods market, corporate headquarters base, Taiwan Venture Park, Beigang Wenchuang practice base and other platforms, supporting preferential policies for Taiwanese and Taiwan businessmen get a tangible, Taiwanese youth have also been well developed. Taiwan compatriots in Pingtan can also enjoy the local health insurance, social security and endowment insurance, children can choose their own schools ... These measures have been more and more Taiwanese compatriots agree and praised. Pingtan open policy of policy development continued to release, attracting more and more compatriots in this live and work. Pingtan to create the ""second life circle"" of Taiwan compatriots began to take shape. At present, Pingtan has entered a new era of accelerating the construction of a comprehensive experimental zone, a free trade pilot zone and an international tourist island. Lin Wenyao believes that after many years of experiments and exploration in cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation, he should not only stay in ""doing business"" but should have a bigger pattern and a bigger accomplishment in the future. He said Pingtan has explored and proposed the concept of ""one area and two targets, inclusive coexistence, integration and development, and a win-win situation for both sides of the Taiwan Strait"", that is, trying out the coexistence and mutual accommodation of mainland standards and Taiwan standards in Pingtan Island in the fields of economy, culture and social administration Recognize each other's exchanges and use the most convenient policy measures to seek more benefits for Taiwan compatriots in Taiwan. In the construction of the free trade area, Pingtan has promoted cross-Strait customs clearance cooperation and has launched the Customs Electronic Information Exchange System across the Strait to initially realize the interconnection and exchange of certificates of origin under the ECFA on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The cross-Strait inspection and quarantine electronic certificate exchange and verification system , To achieve two-way cross-border data exchange and real-time transmission with Taiwan's Customs and Trade Network; Taiwan's first pilot in the mainland to adopt Taiwan's certification and accreditation and inspection and quarantine results. The frequent highlight of cross-Strait financial cooperation is also a major achievement of the construction of Pingtan Free Trade Zone. For example, the ""Taiwan-funded enterprises Taiwan cell credit inquiry pilot"" cracked the purchase of Taiwan compatriots, start-up loan problems; Taiwan Equity Exchange Center set up Taiwan-funded enterprises trading plate, the actual financing of Taiwan enterprises 2.1 billion; Lan Taiwan with the current account, Fujian and Taiwan Syndicated loans, direct cross-strait cross-border loans, the Taiwan dollar concession exchange agencies, the Taiwan dollar to buy direct flights to Taiwan and other business passenger tickets for Taiwanese compatriots provide a wide range of financial services. Lin Wenyao said that in the future, it will further expand its openness to Taiwan, further expand the qualification of qualifications in Taiwan's industries by admitting and approving Taiwan industries, enhance the industrial development platform for cross-Strait development and the youth entrepreneurship platform, and deepen the exchange activities in the areas of culture, sports, education and religion.

I07d9235047d011e7842bfd2e87d40c69.1C,"紫藤斋的主人邓拓一直以来，北京故宫博物院没有书画常设展，一年春秋2季，只得武英殿2场收藏特展，以至于每次去故宫，心里就要叹息，展出的作品实在太少了。好似赴一场盛宴，飢肠辘辘前往，却没有一回看饱过。心欠欠地回了家，又禁不住安慰自己，还有点东西可看，就认了我们没把艺术与美育当回事的命吧！藏品比故宫多但有一次，中国美术馆举办了「邓拓捐赠中国古代绘画珍品特展」，不仅名家荟萃，作品竟比故宫的多出2倍不止，那份饱赏了传统艺术的惊喜，至今刻印在记忆里。正是这次展览，才知道邓拓是谁。也才知道在共产党的高层，竟有艺术造诣如此精深的文人雅士。这个邓拓（1912-1966），早年是《人民日报》的主编，文采蔚然，精于艺术品收藏，对当时的党忠心耿耿。可是，他竟然坚持不向自己忠于的党献媚，爱真理胜于爱党派，不肯将《人民日报》当成一个党派的专属媒体与传声筒，所以很不得专制的待见，毛老人家一句「死人办报」的结论，就把他逐出了《人民日报》报社。逐出也罢了，又号召全国批判他、凌辱他，使他如后来的许多文人大家一样，选择了自杀这唯一的一条可行之路。邓拓对美术馆捐赠出多年的收藏，是在他自杀的前2年。他早嗅出政治的血腥，早闻到政治斗争的残酷气息，自知未来性命有可能不保，便作了最坏打算，要为艺术品找个可靠的去处。不过这些东西不能家传，那只会给他的家人带来灭门灾难；但又不能随便散落别处，那将是艺术品的灾难。几番踌躇，他向国家美术馆作出了捐赠。人可以因言获罪，但艺术品本身却并无罪过。如果幸运，它们或可逃得一劫，这样即使自己遭灾，至少他的半生心血不会化为泡影。盛年自杀离世我并不赞成有人说，他是因为党派之争才造成这样的含冤蒙垢，没有最高指令的发出，谁能自作主张批斗他、踢倒他？将毁灭文化人的责任推给败者，是伪善也是真恶。邓拓于生命的盛年离世，没有写成他一直想写的艺术史，太令人哀伤与痛惜。事实证明邓拓当年将大多数收藏找到美术馆这样一个稳妥的去处，他是有先见之明的。这同时也证明，被毛贬抑的读书人、死秀才，其人格里确实有一种高于现实功利价值的更高价值。看了故宫10几年的收藏展，没有一次比邓拓的收藏展看得更酣畅淋漓，他的收藏主要是沿着元明清的线索一路理过来，苏轼、王蒙、沉周、文徵明、仇英、龚贤、石涛、八大山人、徐渭、吴镇、黄公望、董其昌、陈洪绶、恽寿平、王翬、王原祁、费丹旭、弘仁、华岩、罗聘……奇才如此齐聚，群星如此耀眼。在展览的末尾，一幅金农74岁时画的双色梅花图，如一个大大的惊喜，弥补了展览花卉欠少的缺憾。大尺幅的真迹，从构图到晕染，从点染到勾出朵朵花蕊，何处该手重，何处该手轻，一气呵成，未见一丝老人的手颤。在这幅作品前，人发了很长时间的呆，一边发呆一边在心里为邓拓祈祷，感谢他作为一个文人的远见，感谢他在生命的最后黑暗岁月，将这批作品作了妥善的安置。他如有知他的收藏今天终于见到阳光，成为国宝，想必会轻舒一口长气，嘴角浮起微笑。紫藤斋是邓拓书斋的斋号，我更愿从这种文人化的角度一探他的世界，而不是从政治的角度写他。

","Tang Tuozao, owner of Wisteria Studio, has never had a permanent painting and calligraphy exhibition at the Palace Museum in Beijing. In the Spring and Autumn Period of the year, there were only two collections of Wu Yingdian's collection of special exhibitions. Every time I went to the Forbidden City, my heart sighs. not enough. Like to go to a feast, hungry to go, but not a look full. Heart owed back to the home, and could not help but comfort myself, there is something to see, we recognize the art and aesthetic education should not be the case of life! There are more collections than the Forbidden City. However, once again, the National Art Museum of China held the ""Exhibition of Donations of Donations of Treasures of Ancient Chinese Paintings"" by Deng T'ao. Not only the masters gather more than twice the number of works in the Forbidden City, Imprinted in memory so far. It is this exhibition, who knows who is Deng Tuo. I also learned that at the highest level of the Communist Party, there are literary masters who are so accomplished in art. Deng Tuo (1912-1966), the early editor of Renmin Ribao, was a literary genre who excelled in art collection and was loyal to the party at the time. However, he insisted on not obsequious himself loyal to the party, love the truth than love the party, refused to ""People's Daily"" as a party exclusive media and sound management, it is not despotic to be seen, Mao old man, ""the dead do Reported ""the conclusion, put him out of the"" People's Daily ""newspaper. He also demanded that the nation criticize him and insult him so that he, like many later writers, chose the only feasible way of suicide. Dinton donated many years of collection to the museum, two years before he committed suicide. He had sniffed the blood of politics early and had long smelled the cruel atmosphere of the political struggle. He knew that his future life might not be protected and he would make the worst plan and find a reliable place to go for works of art. However, these things can not be handed down, it will only bring devastating consequences to his family; but can not be scattered elsewhere, it will be a disaster of artwork. Repeatedly hesitated, he made a donation to the National Gallery. People can be convicted of words, but the artwork itself is not guilty. If they are lucky, they can either flee, so at least his half-life will not come to naught if he is hit. Suicide suicide death years I do not agree with someone said that he was because of the party dispute was caused by such grievances, without the highest order issued, who can advocate criticize him, kick him? Putting the responsibility of destroying a literate to a loser is hypocrisy and evil. DENG T'ao died in his grand life and did not write down the history of art that he always wanted to write. It was sad and deplorable. It turns out that he had found the most secure collection of art galleries for most of his collections that year. This at the same time also proves that the grossly degraded scholar and deceased scholar do indeed have a higher value in their personal qualities than their utilitarian values. After reading the collection exhibition of the Forbidden City in the past 10 years, there was never a more enjoyable exhibition than the collection exhibition of Deng Tuo. His collection mainly followed the clues of Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties. Su Shi, Wang Meng, Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming , Qiu Ying, Gong Xian, Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Xu Wei, Wu Zhen, Huang Gongwang, Dong Qichang, Chen Hongshou, 恽 Shouping, Wang 翚, Wang Yuanqi, Fei Danxu, Hong Ren, Hua Yan, Luo ... ...... so Wizards gathered stars So bright At the end of the exhibition, a picture of Meihua Holdings Group Co.,Ltd.,a two-color picture of Jinnong at the age of 74, made a big surprise to make up for the lack of flowers in the exhibition. Large-scale authentic, from the composition to the blooming, from the point of dyed to tick blossoming stamens, where the hand weight, where the hand light, one go, no trace of the elderly hand trembling. Before this work, the man spent a long time staying in his heart while praying for Dinton. He thanked him for his foresight as a literary man, and thanked him for making the works proper in the final dark years of his life. Place. If he knows his collection today finally see the sun, become a national treasure, presumably will be a light-hearted stretch of breath, his mouth floating smile. Wisteria is the denial of denomination, and I prefer to look at his world from such a literary perspective rather than writing him politically.",紫藤斋的主人邓拓,Not Reuters,12:02AM 12 Sep 2016,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I07d9235047d011e7842bfd2e87d40c69.1C.html

国企改革当炒A股保持「慢牛」格局，沪指及深指上周分别升0.99%及1.25%。市场炒作概念不多，「一带一路」再被热捧，建筑建材板块表现凌厉，升幅达5.87%。不过备受打压的房地产则跌1.25%。当前，内地银根收紧的因素仍对股市及楼市带来困扰，A股横行格局尚难突破。上周「深股通」及「沪股通」名单中，升幅排名第一位的均为基建概念股，其中西部建设（002302.SZ）升39%、中材国际（600970.SH）升27%。另外，国企改革概念股亦有炒作，中核科技（000777.SZ）升25%、中国国旅（601888.SH）升5.6%。人行收紧货币政策周末人行行长周小川出席博鳌亚洲论坛时表示，「经过多年的量化宽鬆后，我们已经到达了这次周期的尾部，货币政策不再是宽鬆的了」。中国此前仍一直强调货币政策要适度宽鬆，今次首次由人行行长口中说出不再宽鬆的字眼。其实，就算周小川不说，人行近期的行动早已表现出收紧的意图。在季末流动性转紧的情况下，人行未有积极「放水」。结果导致上海银行间同业拆放利率（SHIBOR）持续上升，其中1个月期SHIBOR连升17日至4.4581%，创2015年4月13日以来高位。货币政策的收紧暂时未对股市带来明显的影响。
沪深两市指数保持上升之外，上周两市的日均成交金额反而比前一周增加约300亿元（人民币．下同）至5360亿元。至于对楼市的影响方面，相信需要更长的时间才足以反映。3月份70大中城市新建商品住宅楼价大多仍保持上升，只有3个城市同比下跌。不过，随着各地政府持续收紧调控，相信楼价升幅将持续收窄。目前除一线城市严格限购之外，热点二三线城市亦纷纷加强调控。广东中山周末亦推出限购令，暂停向已拥有三套房的当地户籍居民及拥有两套房的非户籍居民出售住宅；首套房贷款首期不低于三成，二套房贷款首期不低于四成。内地专家学者之中亦出现不少看澹楼市的声音。
齐鲁资管首席经济学家李迅雷出席博鳌亚洲论坛演讲时指出，2020年前后，中国房价普遍出现下跌。只因未来人口增长速度及人口流动减慢、经济增长放缓及货币增速下降等因素，已不支持楼价上涨。专家看澹楼市前景李迅雷指出，去年外出农民工只增加50万人，表明经济趋势往下，城市化进程亦放缓。去年合肥、厦门房价大涨，主因当地人口流入量属全国前列位置。相反，大连西安2015、16年房价却下跌，背后原因正是人口减少。人口因素的确是影响楼价的重要因素，单看日本在人口老化的影响下，过去二十年来，楼市一直低迷。对同样面对人口老化的中国来说，同样值得警惕。过去三十年买入住宅的人士，目前迎来了资产的大幅增值。但目前以高位买入住宅的人士，三十年后极可能步日本后尘，资产大为贬值。当然，没有人是先知，三十年前没有人预计到今天的楼价，现时大家对未来楼价的走向亦难以说得准。当前内地楼价尚未下跌，但地产股已率先下挫。股市表现往往早于实体经济，所以，在调控加强的情况下，楼价前景亦不乐观。房地产板块上周表现疲弱，相信未来一段时间要翻身的机会不大。投资者不妨继续专注政策受惠股，国企改革的炒作相信未完，除了央企之外，上海、广州等不同地区的国企，改革工作的推行亦将带来炒作机遇。不过，国企旗下股份众多，要买中涨停股并不容易。投资者不妨分散投资，买入不同地方及行业概念，以博取更大的上升机会。

","Real estate surrounded by the enemy
Reform of State-owned Enterprises When the speculation in A-shares maintained a ""slow cow"" pattern, the Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Stock Exchange advanced 0.99% and 1.25% respectively last week. The concept of market speculation is limited. The ""One Belt, One Road"" was again touted and the building materials sector performed sharply, an increase of 5.87%. However, the suppressed real estate fell 1.25%. At present, the factors that have tightened monetary conditions in the Mainland still plague the stock market and property market. The cross-border pattern of A shares is still hard to break through. China Infrastructure Construction Co.,Ltd. (002302.SZ) climbed 39%, Sinoma International (Holdings) Limited (002302.SZ) rose to No. 1 position in the list of ""Shenzhen Stocks"" and "" 600970.SH) rose 27%. In addition, there were speculation in state-owned reform stocks, with China Nuclear Technology (000777.SZ) up 25% and China International Travel Service Corporation Limited (601888.SH) up 5.6%. Took monetary tightening over the weekend When Zhou Xiaochuan, chairman of the People's Bank of China said at the Boao Forum for Asia weekend, ""After years of quantitative easing, we have reached the end of this cycle and monetary policy is no longer lenient."" China had always stressed that monetary policy should be modest and relaxed. For the first time this time, the alibi president said that no longer loose words. In fact, even if Zhou Xiaochuan did not say that the recent moves of the PBOC already showed the intention of tightening up. In the case of liquidity tightening at the end of the quarter, the PBOC has not actively ""released water"". As a result, SHIBOR continued to rise, with one-month SHIBOR rising for a 17-day rise to 4.4581%, its highest level since April 13, 2015. The tightening of monetary policy temporarily has no significant impact on the stock market.
Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets kept rising except the average daily turnover of the two cities last week increased by about 30 billion yuan (RMB) from the previous week to 536 billion yuan. As for the impact on the property market, I believe it will take longer to be sufficiently reflective. In March, the prices of newly-built commercial residential buildings in 70 major cities were mostly still rising, with only three cities falling year-on-year. However, with the continued tightening of controls by various local governments, we believe property price increases will continue to narrow. At present, except for first-tier cities strictly limited purchase, hot second and third tier cities have also stepped up regulation and control. Zhongshan Weekend also launched a purchase order to suspend the sale of residential dwellings to local residents who already own three suites and non-resident residents who own two suites; the loan amount for the first suite is no less than 30% and the loan for the second suite is no less than 40%. Many experts and scholars from the Mainland also appear in the market.
When attending the speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, Li Lulei, chief economist of Qilu Asset Management, pointed out that housing prices generally dropped in China around 2020. The increase in property prices has no longer supported the future growth of population and the slowing of population movements, the slowdown in economic growth and the slowdown of currency growth. Experts Look at Market Prospects Li Thunder pointed out that the number of migrant workers going out last year only increased by 500,000, indicating that the economic trend is going down and the urbanization process is also slowing down. Last year, Hefei and Xiamen rose sharply, mainly due to the influx of local population is the forefront of the country. On the contrary, Dalian Xi'an 2015, 16 years, prices have fallen, behind the reason is the population decline. Population factor is indeed an important factor affecting property prices. Just looking at the impact of population aging in Japan, the property market has been in a downturn for the past 20 years. For China, who is also facing an aging population, it is equally worth vigilance. People who bought homes over the past three decades now have a significant appreciation of their assets. However, those who buy houses at a high level are likely to follow Japan in the next 30 years and their assets have greatly depreciated. Of course, no one is a prophet. Thirty years ago no one expected the property prices today. At present, we are not sure about the direction of future property prices. The current mainland property prices have not dropped, but real estate stocks have been the first to fall. Stock market performance is often earlier than the real economy. Therefore, under the control of the economy, the outlook for property prices is not optimistic. The performance of the real estate sector was weak last week, I believe there is little chance of turning around for some time in the future. Investors may wish to continue to focus on benefiting from the policy stocks. The speculation in state-owned enterprises reform is still to be seen. In addition to central enterprises, state-owned enterprises in different regions such as Shanghai and Guangzhou will also bring speculation opportunities. However, a large number of state-owned shares, to buy the daily limit is not easy. Investors may wish to diversify their investment and buy into different local and industry concepts to gain greater chances for growth.",地产四面受敌 国企改革当炒,Not Reuters,04:13PM 27 Aug 2017,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I07dbb790126b11e79dccf055406ffee1.1C.html

The data show that after the strong growth in the first quarter, China's economy did not slow down much and made people feel at ease. [nL3T1IX08V] Industry surveys show that China Steel Corporation's industry growth rebounded to its fastest pace in a year, benefiting from the growth of new orders, which boosted the prices of Shanghai iron ore and rebar futures.

Investors are still cautious about chasing high up despite the signs that the global economy is turning around.

This is in stark contrast to a series of polls showing that the Conservative majority will gain ground. [nL3T1IW48O] ""The British election situation may lead to the pound sterling in the next few weeks to experience the gloomy-like situation,"" Stephen OANDA senior trader Stephen
Innnes said. Earlier, a series of polls showed that the Conservative Party's leading edge has narrowed, which has shaken investor confidence in the Conservative Party's easy access to the majority in the June 8 general election and may lead to market uncertainty. The dollar was hurled near the two-week low against the safe haven yen amid caution in Europe over political concerns and the weak performance of the stock and commodity markets after the long weekend in the United States. The dollar hit a near two-week low of 110.665 yen against the yen at 110.85. US Treasury yields regained their downtrend earlier this month and the dollar weakened thereafter. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was 2.21%, 2.41% two weeks ago. On commodities, oil prices remain weak as lingering concerns over whether OPEC and other oil-producing nations could cut their output more than enough to support oil prices. US crude oil futures fell about 0.1% to 49.61 US dollars a barrel. Brent crude remained flat at 51.84. Spot gold plunged to $ 1,262 an ounce.

王笈在上海市奉贤区柘林镇的奉柘公路旁，一条由数层石块堆砌而成的石海塘平行于海岸线延绵数里，距今已有近300年历史。海塘名唤“华亭古海塘”，始建于清代雍正三年（1725年），整个工程耗时10年，是罕见的一例石砌古海塘。历史上的华亭古海塘西起金山戚家墩龙珠庵，东到柘林镇奉海村华家角，高2到4米，底宽2.4到3米，地下基础深1米，全长47.5里，号称“四十里金城”。民间曾流传过一句古语，“北有古长城，南有华亭东石塘”，当地人也把这条海塘称为“上海小长城”。48岁的沉玉琴自小生活在古海塘边，说起华亭古海塘的历史滔滔不绝，“我们这个古海塘的前身叫‘华亭捍海塘堰’，始建于南宋乾道八年（1172年）。土塘容易坍塌，但是为了不让潮水冲击内地，历朝历代只能不断修建被冲塌的土塘。直到清雍正二年（1724年），汹涌的海潮再次冲毁海塘，惊动了朝廷；雍正五年，当时的皇帝钦定华亭海塘全线改为石质海塘。”石海塘由条青石和花岗石堆成，内外包砌，油灰嵌缝，外层条石用银来锭形，创造了“条石以铁销、铁笋相连”的方桉。海塘不仅抵制潮水来袭，还肩负着抵御倭寇的重要职责。如今，人们所能看到的露出地表部分的古海塘全长约4公里。1996年奉柘公路降坡前，这段古海塘常年被泥土包裹、埋藏于地下，两百多年都未显真容。2002年，华亭古海塘被公布为上海市级文物保护单位，这座守卫了数百年沿海人们安宁生活的古海塘，在离开大海数公里之远、再无原有功能的今天，终于变为了“被守护”的一方，得以“安享晚年”。“以前石海塘没有被挖出来的时候，村民们都是沿土坡上下出行；上世纪90年代公路降坡后，土坡没有了，为了方便周边村民出行，石海塘就被破开了大大小小11个缺口。”沉玉琴说，“这些年，我们按照文物标准逐渐修复了好几个缺口，在此基础上打造了生态园林区，在沿线1.13公里铺设草皮、植被，组合种植了各种花卉。”300年前人们凭海临风的华亭古海塘边，在300年后的今天四季有花、四季常绿，自然风光甚是美丽。未来，这里的绿化深化工程还将与海塘文化结合，集中展示柘林的本土文化。“我们的滚灯文化也有近800年的历史了，其实也是过去驻扎在这里的民间抗倭团队，闲暇时比武，舞动装泥块的竹筐，最后就演变成了滚灯文化。这里的很多文化都是和华亭古海塘紧密联系在一起的。”沉玉琴告诉记者。（完）

正因为肾主骨、生髓、通脑，骨髓留于骨中，能营养骨骼，使骨骼生长并坚固有力，所以小儿发育不健康，均为肾的精气不足之表现。其次，嵴髓上通于脑，所以思维迟钝、记忆力减退等症状，也可透过补肾得以改善。由于肾亦主水液，所以它亦跟人体体液分佈调节，以及排泄功能有密切关係，例如肾气不足即易有尿量减少、排尿困难或尿频、夜尿等问题。肾虚调养大不同
一般坊间所称的「肾亏」，其实正确说法应是「肾气亏损」，这并不止反映在性功能上，也会影响到身体其他部位，包括身体及智力的发展、生育能力、更年期问题、记忆力减退、腰痠背痛、四肢冰冷、尿频、盗汗及耳鸣头晕等问题，均与「肾气虚损」有关。肾虚又可分肾阳虚、肾阴虚、肾气虚、肾精虚四大类，必须因应证状作出相应调理，并由注册中医师诊断，再「对证下药」调理。食疗穴按补肾
虽然男女体质各异，但只要有良好的生活习惯，再配合适当的穴位刺激和食材进补，即可发挥很大的补肾功效，当中主要包括生活作息正常。另亦可以刺激穴位的方法来防治肾阴虚，如按摩足底的涌泉穴（脚底中间凹陷部位，即约足掌前三分之一处），建议可每天按摩一次，每次五分钟，长期持续即可起调补肾阴作用。食疗可选用较中性温和的药食同源进补方，如属于肾阳虚可多吃「b白乌鸡糯米粥」，以糯米、b白、莲子、花椒，配乌鸡熬粥，惟食用前应先谘询医生意见。《亲子王》在facebook

","Children's kidney damage resistance Chinese medicine as the innate nature of the kidney, in fact, more than adults to kidney, the kid should also maintain the kidneys, because it also helps to improve overall physical fitness and reduce pain. Text: 嬷 From the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, the kidney is one of the most important organs responsible for the basic health elements of many kinds of human bodies. Therefore, both men, women and children need proper protection of renal function. A registered Chinese medicine practitioner, Dr Chan Hon-hung, said that the kidneys are ""refined"" and have to do with the growth, development and reproduction of the human body. This refined spirit comes from the essence of parents' innate essence. From the beginning of childhood, the essence of kidney essence is constantly growing, Adults. Strong bones healthy growth
Because of renal primary bone, raw marrow, Tongnao, bone marrow left in the bone, can nutrition bones, so that bone growth and strong, so children with unhealthy development, are the performance of the lack of essence of the kidney. Second, the ridges on the brain, so slow thinking, memory loss and other symptoms, but also can be improved by tonifying the kidneys.

Kidney conditioning different

I09eafe80424d11e7aea2c2ba0a9cb838.1C,"体育黄金屋5月26日，周五。古语有云，书中自有黄金屋。今时今日，读书依然重要，但运动亦已经发展成一个大行业，提供不少投资黄金机会，绝对不容忽视。重文轻武，过时矣。对于体育如何推动经济，助人发达，从本地前高官、体坛知名人士到内地富商巨贾，各有各的心得，惟英雄所见略同。体育为何可以为香港打开一条黄金大道，年轻时练过武，而且参加过自由搏击比赛的曾俊华，曾经在一篇盛讚香港拳王曹星如的博文中分享过他的想法。曾俊华提到，赛事门票收益、转播权、广告、商业赞助，全都是重要收入来源。首富野心大在这个基础上开枝散叶，还有运动用品、开班授徒等，产业链非常庞大。「薯片叔叔」更以国际七人榄球赛为例，说明运动比赛能带动旅游、酒店、餐饮以至零售业。跑步发烧友梁百行创立「全城街马」社企，举办过多项赛事。「去外国跑步是一个trip，很多人比赛事小，玩事大。」梁百行接受《信报月刊》访问时如是说，皆因跑手惯常会多留几天观光。梁氏又认为，若能善用路线设计，更可引领跑手穿梭香江，饱览怡人的郊野公园景致，令他们对香港留下一个更立体的印象。远在中国东北的石油重镇大庆，亦希望靠体育转型，走出旧经济困局。大庆先后举办过桌球国际锦标赛、世界大力士公开赛，以及各类国际篮球、龙舟、拳赛等，
又希望进一步开发冰雪及水上活动，寄望体育转播令全世界感受到大庆的存在。关于如何把体育发展成一盘大生意，
要数中国首富、万达集团老闆王健林最在行。神州大地不少大商家都剑指体育市场，但在芸芸内地富豪中，以王氏开拓体育帝国野心最大、动作最多。体育有多值钱，王健林早就研究得一清二楚。全球计，体育产业总值达到2万亿美元，这还未算进体育用品的庞大销售收益，单是运动比重、转播权等涉及的经济价值，便贡献美国3%
GDP，日本比例相若，达2.6%。中国不到1%，急起直追空间甚大。对运动员而言，最重要的莫过于刷新纪录改写历史，为国争光之馀，个人名利双收。对商家来说，赛事样样关乎银纸，
冠名、服装赞助、运动员代言等，全皆相金先惠。媒体转播权，热门赛事动不动天价不在话下，即使记者採访权都要收费。有钱就身痕财路多多外，体育行业另有一个特质非常吸引首富。体育事业不怕被科技颠覆，知名赛事愈老愈值钱，永远属于朝阳事业。体坛盛事、名牌赛事有天然「护城河」，单看各国争崩头主办世界盃、奥运等，就知複製一个同类型大赛有多困难。近年在中国市场搞体育，既有人和亦得天时之助。中国人生活水平不断提高，
有钱自然「身痕」，对体育等休閒活动需求大增。更何况，体育不光是娱乐，亦对健康有好处，健康概念对准中产一定sell得，前景怎会不乐观？中国不少消费品市场早已超越美国成为世界第一，但体育市场依然远远落后花旗，王健林认为问题在于参与体育人口严重不足，而参与人数低又与设施少有关（中国每13万人才有一个足球场，美国4.6万人）。万达三年多前开始部署，由收购体育公司盈方开始，几年间通过併购或与其他机构合作，获得三项铁人赛、单车世界巡迴赛、篮球世界盃等赛事主办权。按王健林的如意算盘，若能陆续把国外热门赛事搬到中国，建立一个自己拥有知识产权的赛事portfolio，财源滚滚势在必然。体育綑绑旅游体育更可以结合万达其他生意，比如要看万达搞的比赛，只能通过万达旗下旅游公司订票，以体育綑绑旅游。他日万达体育独立上市，不妨押上一注，实行跟首富搵食。

","Sports Golden House on May 26, Friday. Old saying goes, the book own golden house. Nowadays, studying remains important, but the movement has also developed into a big industry that offers many golden opportunities for investment. It is absolutely not to be overlooked. Heavy text light, outdated carry on. For sports how to promote the economy, helping others, from the former top officials, sports celebrities to the wealthy businessman in the Mainland, each have their own experience, but the hero's alike. Why did sports open a golden avenue for Hong Kong and practice martial arts in his youth? And John Tsang, who participated in a free-kick fight, shared his thoughts in a blog post praising Hong Kong champion Cao Xingru. Ceng Junhua mentioned that the proceeds of the tournament tickets, broadcast rights, advertising, commercial sponsorship, all are important sources of income. The richest man of the richest foundations on this basis, such as loose leaves, as well as sporting goods, apprenticeships, etc.,the industry chain is very large. Taking Underage, for example, the ""International Rugby Sevens"" as an example shows that sporting events can lead to travel, hotels, restaurants and even retail. Runner-enthusiast Liang Baihang founded a social enterprise called ""Whole Street Horse"" and organized a number of events. ""Running to a foreign country is a trip, and many people play smaller games and play big games."" In his interview with The Monthly Journal, Leung Pak-line said that because of the usual practice of running a few days to go sightseeing. Leung also believes that if we can make the best use of the route design, we can lead the runners to shuttle Hong Kong and enjoy the pleasant scenery of the country parks, leaving them with a more three-dimensional impression of Hong Kong. As far as Daqing, the oil-heavy town in northeast China, also hopes to rely on sports transformation and get out of the old economic dilemma. Daqing has held the International Table Tennis Championships, the World Hercules Open, as well as various types of international basketball, dragon boat, boxing match,
I hope further development of ice and snow and water activities, hope sports broadcast so that the world feel the presence of Daqing. How to develop sports into a big business,
To the number of China's richest man, Wanda Group boss Wang Jianlin most in the line. Many large businesses in the vast territory of China refer to the sports market. However, among the rich in the Mainland, Wang has pioneered the largest sporting ambitions and has the most movements. How much money sports, Wang Jianlin study has been crystal clear. Globally, the total value of the sports industry has reached 2 trillion U.S. dollars, which is not yet accounted for by the huge sales proceeds of sporting goods. The economic value involved in sports weight and broadcasting right alone contributes 3%
GDP, Japan, the same proportion, up 2.6%. Less than 1% of China is in a hurry to catch up. For athletes, the most important thing is to refresh the record to rewrite history, glory for the country, personal fame and fortune. For businesses, the game is about silver paper,
Title, apparel sponsorship, athlete endorsements, etc.,all are phase Xianghui. Media rights, popular hot topic immutable price goes without saying, even if the press interview charges. There is plenty of money on the trail of money, sports industry, another trait is very attractive to the richest man. Sports are not afraid to be subverted by science and technology, the more famous and famous, the more valuable, always belong to Chaoyang career. Sports events, brand-name events have a natural ""moat"", just look at the national competition for the collapse of host World Cup, the Olympic Games, I know how difficult it is to copy a type of competition. In recent years to engage in sports in the Chinese market, both RENHE COMMERCIAL HOLDINGS COMPANY LIMITED also get the time to help. Chinese living standards continue to improve,
Rich and natural ""body marks"", sports and other leisure activities greatly increased demand. What's more, sports are not just entertainment, but also health benefits. The concept of health must be sold to middle-class people. What are the prospects? Many consumer goods markets in China have surpassed the United States to become the No. 1 in the world, but the sports market is still far behind Citi. Wang Jianlin believes the problem is the serious lack of participation in the sports population. However, the low number of participants and the lack of facilities (China has a football for every 130,000 people) Field, the United States 4.6 million). Wanda began its deployment more than three years ago, starting with the acquisition of the sports company Ying Fang. In a few years, it won the bid to host three triathlon, cycling world tournaments and basketball World Cups through mergers and acquisitions or other agencies. According to Wang Jianlin's wishful thinking, if one after another to move the hot events abroad to China, to establish a portfolio with their own intellectual property rights, money is inevitable.

I0a8d07e044df11e7b30880defb202d46.1C,"获新收费电视牌吴天海功成身退
89%股东支持永升入主有线宽频避过停播有线宽频逃出关台停播鬼门关！昨日小股东以约八成九支持票，通过大比例供股方桉，而负责供股包销的永升，将一跃成为有线控股股东。有线主席吴天海昨日指出，议桉获股东通过后，已第一时间签认接纳收费电视新牌照，以及提交予当局，并指有线电视六月一日将如常运作。他又指，完成交易后，他便会离开公司，又强调该公司今年以来并无裁员，会尽力挽留员工。本报财经组吴天海指未来几星期会尽快与永升主席邱达昌及其代表商讨用甚麽方法做到一个「直通车」的安排，希望永升入主后，有线原有政策不会出现一百八十度改变，以致令有线员工无所适从或对用
不公。他表示，商讨内容主要有两点，一为加强永升对有线业务的认识，二为向其提出有线业务将来发展的建议。如果发展方向与现时的并非南辕北辙，会尽力配合。寻求「直通车」式交接被问及永升入主，会否涉及裁员时，吴天海澄清该公司今年以来并无裁员，但承认年初至今有三百名、约一成半的员工自然流失，会尽力挽留能力高的员工。他保证在新投资者入主前，不会在裁员上有大动作。被问及有线新闻部的负责人会否被撤换，吴天海指，与永升的转让条款有要求保留现在新闻管理层。他亦未与邱达昌再就此商讨，不清楚邱达昌早前指想节省一成人手与自然流失的一成半是否同样的人、同样的岗位。他又指虽然自己在交易完成后便会离开有线，但表示，离开公司并非该公司结束之日，是很大的欣慰。邱达昌称不会大换管理层邱达昌向传媒表示，对有线供股方桉获通过感高兴，他希望人事变动愈少愈好，不会大批更换管理层，接手后会否裁员需与新团队从长计议，现时言之尚早。至于新闻部其后会否出现大变革，他表示「改变多少都会有」，未来有线将更注重财经及金融新闻。商务及经济发展局局长苏锦樑表示有线已签署了收费电视的续期牌照，并于六月一日生效，为期十二年。通讯事务管理局会就新投资者或任何股权变动，根据程序进行审批。有线宽频股权转让获批后会进行供股，最快九月中新资金才到位，而现时至九月之间的过渡期公司有足够资金营运。有线宽频的股权重组大计，主要透过每三股供五股大比例方式供股进行，供股价为每股零点二一元，估计集资七亿零四百万元，同时又把欠下母公司九仓的三亿元债务转为股份，令债务减少。有线大股东九仓表明不会供股，而供股包销商永升将透过包销股份而取得有线控制权，完成供股、债务资本化、股份分派之后，永升最多将会取得有线近五成八股权，实际持股，须视乎有多少有线股东供股，九龙仓股权将由佔百分之七十四降至百分之十一，令控股权正式易手。新牌为期12年
六月生效将入主有线宽频的永升，股东背景可谓星光熠熠。永升大股东是郑家纯，个人持有永升百分之三十一点五股权。郑家纯家族旗下的周大福企业，持有永升一成四股权，即是说，郑家纯直接及间接持有永升百分之四十五点五股权。远东发展主席邱达昌持永升百分之二十四点五股权，富力地产创办人李思廉持一成六，私募基金弘毅投资创办人赵令欢持馀下的一成四。

英国央行政策会议料按兵不动* 美国将公布零售销售和核心通胀数据路透伦敦5月5日 -
欧盟和欧元的命运，可能系在周日法国总统大选结果上。亲欧盟的中间派候选人马克龙预计会赢得大选，市场会将马克龙胜选视为欧洲政治风险正在消退的迹象。而如若极右翼候选人勒庞意外胜出，则法国弃用欧元、甚至退出欧盟的风险将升温。周五公布的调查显示，马克龙以62%对38%的支持率遥遥领先勒庞。但鉴于近期诸如特朗普入主白宫和去年英国退欧等令人震惊的政治事件，投资者对民调保持戒慎。勒庞最近澹化让法国退出欧盟和弃用欧元的计划，称这也许不是她的优先要务。不过最新路透调查显示，如果勒庞当选法国总统，则欧元可能将重挫5%。[nL4S1I61J1]没有主要调查显示勒庞会当选，但若真的胜选，可能会加剧金融市场波动，尤其是欧洲股市、债市和汇市的波动。而若马克龙当选，则会维持现状。""我们预计马克龙在周日的法国总统大选第二轮投票中胜出。这样的结果会让欧元区的政治风险沉寂一段时间，""法国农业信贷银行(Credit

Marinov说。上月的路透调查显示，未来一欧元区经济增长预计将稳定但温和，但这在一定程度上要取决于马克龙入主爱丽舍宫。[nL3S1HS27E]未来一周，欧元区无计划发布关于第二季初经济表现的重要数据，但周五数据将显示工业生产在第一季末时力道如何。本周稍早的采购经理人指数(PMI)显示，欧元区企业活动在2017年第二季开局创下六年来最佳表现，暗示欧元区经济普遍且持续复苏。**英国央行料按兵不动**海峡彼岸的英国，自退欧公投以来经济表现意外的好。英国央行将召开政策会议，但预计不会有意外之举。接受路透访问的62位分析师，无一预计英国央行周四会对处于纪录低点0.25%的利率做出调整。最近的路透调查预计，央行至少在2019年之前都将按兵不动，观望退欧谈判的进展。调查显示，若谈判吵得不可开交，会给英国经济构成最大风险；若谈判进展顺利，则将是最为利好经济的因素。据路透调查，有近三分之二的外汇策略师认为英国执政的保守党在6月大选将会赢得压倒性的胜利。[nL4S1I61DS]
因此英国在退欧谈判中的立场可能将由特雷莎梅来决定。若民调预估准确，则特雷莎梅的退欧路线将赢得新的有力支持。""离英国6月8日大选剩下不到五周时间，政治也可能成为重点关注对象，""Investec分析师团队的报告称。英国央行还需要考量的是，通胀率守在2%上方，今年还将超越薪资增幅，支撑经济的消费者支出因而遭到冲击。英国央行还将公布季度通胀报告，统计局将发布工业生产和建筑业产出，此外贸易收支和英国皇家测量师协会(RICS)房价差值也将出炉。未来一周还有新西兰、马来西亚、秘鲁和菲律宾的央行召开会议。预计这些央行也会维持政策现状。中国将公布一系列月度数据。近来中国当局强调金融稳定风险，密切监控信贷，所以4月数据将引发关注。美国方面的重要数据很少，但周五的零售销售和核心通胀数据，料夯实美国联邦储备理事会(美联储/FED)在6月升息的预期。(完)****如欲参考原文报导，请点选[nL8N1I71ZO]即可撷取浏览****(编译

","""One week economic focus"" French election affects the fate of the euro, the Bank of England expected to maintain the status quo of the policy * Mark Kelon is expected to win the French general election, but the market is still vigilant Le Pen * Reuters survey expects Jollopan elected euro fell 5% *
Bank of England policy meeting held steady * The United States will release retail sales and core inflation data London, May 5 -
The fate of the EU and the euro may be tied to the outcome of the French presidential election on Sunday. Markelon, a pro-EU centrist candidate, is expected to win the election and Markham won the election as a sign that the political risk in Europe is receding. And if the right-wing candidate Le Pen accident win, then the French to abandon the euro, and even exit the EU the risk will heat up. A survey released Friday showed Mr. Macron ahead of Le Pen with a 62% support rate of 38%. But given the recent shocking political events such as Trump's move to the White House and Brexit last year, investors are cautious about polls. Le Pen recently liberalized France's plans to withdraw from the European Union and abandon the euro, arguing that this may not be her priority. However, the latest Reuters survey showed that if Le Pen was elected French president, the euro may be set to fall 5%. [nL4S1I61J1] No major survey shows Le Pen will be elected, but if really win the election, may aggravate financial market volatility, especially in Europe stock market, bond market and foreign exchange fluctuations. If Mark Long was elected, will maintain the status quo. ""We expect Markel to win the second round of voting on Sunday's French presidential election, which will quiet the political risk in the euro area for some time,"" Credit Suisse
Valentin of Agricole
Marinov said. A Reuters survey last month showed that the future economic growth in the Eurozone is expected to be steady but moderate, but this depends to a certain extent on the entry of Macron into the Elysee Palace. [nL3S1HS27E] In the coming week, there is no plan to release important data on the economic performance of the second quarter in the euro zone, but the data on Friday will show how the industrial production will be strong at the end of the first quarter. Earlier this week, the purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed that business activity in the euro area set the best performance in six years in the second quarter of 2017, suggesting a general and sustained recovery of the economy in the euro area. ** The Bank of England is bulldozing Britain, on the other side of the Straits, has had an unexpectedly good economic performance since the EU referendum. The Bank of England will hold a policy meeting, but no unexpected move is expected. None of the 62 analysts interviewed by Reuters expected any adjustment by the Bank of England to a record 0.25% interest rate on Thursday. According to a recent Reuters survey, the central bank will hold its position at least until 2019 and wait and see the progress of the UN-EU negotiations. According to the survey, if the negotiation is frivolous, it will pose the greatest risk to the UK economy. If the negotiation progresses smoothly, it will be the most favorable factor for the economy. According to Reuters survey, nearly two-thirds of foreign exchange strategists think the British Conservative Conservatives will win an overwhelming victory in June's election. [nL4S1I61DS]
Therefore, the position of Britain in Brexit talks will probably be decided by Teresa May. If accurate polls predict Terresham's exit from the EU line will win new strong support. ""Less than five weeks after Britain left the June 8 election, politics could become a key concern,"" the report from the Investec analyst team said. The Bank of England also needs to consider that inflation will remain above 2% and will surpass the salary increase this year. As a result, consumer spending on the economy will be hit. The Bank of England will also release a quarterly inflation report, which will release industrial production and construction output, as well as trade balances and RICS house price differences. In the coming week there will also be a meeting of central banks in New Zealand, Malaysia, Peru and the Philippines. It is expected that these central banks will also maintain the status quo of the policy. China will release a series of monthly figures. Chinese authorities recently emphasized the risks of financial stability and closely monitored credit, so the April data will cause concern. There is very little important data in the United States, but Friday's retail sales and core inflation data are expected to underpin the US Federal Reserve's (Fed / FED) rate hike in June.

收入稳步上扬，惟去季营业额约3.87亿欧罗，商业价值12.18亿欧罗排在欧洲第9位，比起英超的曼城、阿仙奴、车路士和利物浦仍要低。钞票多，吸引力自然高，正如打工仔喜欢投身巨无霸企业，《转会市场》推算皇马决赛正选总身价达7.6亿欧罗，祖记只有4.5亿欧罗，甚至逊于青春班的热刺。「很难拒绝皇马的招手。」艾华路莫拉达（Morata）为了更多上阵而改投祖记，去年夏天却抵不住诱惑而重投皇马怀抱，结果还是被BBC组合挤往冷板凳。祖记暗藏福星老实讲，波始终是圆的，钞票多、球星多又不一定赢波。祖记男神不多，守护神保方（Buffon）是40岁老男神，前线也有新晋小生保罗戴巴拿（Dybala），惟关键人物应该是季尾遇神杀神的丹尼尔（Dani）。这位巴西福将天生冠军命，効力巴塞时已赢过3次欧联，加上在西维尔的经历，总共13次晋级决赛，其中12次捧盃。他离队时告诉巴塞「一定会在欧联挂住我」，说不定会一语成谶。兵无将而不动，柯历利（Allergi）和施丹球员时代无得比，但教波后殊途同归，同样奉行多变的战术，上任伊始也受尽非议，一步步赢得认同。祖记虽然被看低一线，但近3次交锋悉数不败，施丹穿起黑白斑马战衣时，曾同柯历利所在佩鲁加踢过一场，时为1996年9月，两黄一红被逐，不幸地留下了不快回忆。每逢大赛，外国博彩公司会开出五花八门出其不意的盘口，如施丹重演06年世盃的「头撞心口」，有500倍，只是对象由恶人马特拉斯（Materazzi）换成柯历利，
得啖笑！其他有趣盘口，C朗继欧国盃决赛后，再次被飞蛾扑脸，赔率为100倍；白礼达（Blatter）突然现身卡迪夫千禧球场，更达1000倍。《异形》系列告诫我们，人是人，神是神，人自以为神，必然踏上自我毁灭之路。撰文

","European League final
The battle between God and humanity, Messi, may be the closest person to God on the court, but when it comes to the goddess, the number of Real Madrid is certainly the highest in the world, headed by Ronaldo Handsome handsome type is handsome, the audience less force will be shaped like losing control to prey. Even if Jundasi is the league title, financial strength, popularity, there is still a huge gap, Karl, just like a battle of people and gods in different sectors! As the name implies, Real Madrid nicknamed the Galaxy Fleet, star-studded by the line-up forever, C Long, Ramos, Ramos (Rodríguez) kicked the air, no wonder popular in social networking sites The degree of throwing nine women from the old street. Compare the two teams in fb popularity, the first eight are Real Madrid, fans at least 11 million, Superstar C Lang even more attracted 120 million, more than the first 11 opponents of the sum. Besides, Dadong also owns 100 million fans in ig, coach Qidan has 12 million, and the official account of older women is 5 million more. Nowadays, popular big convertible banknotes, Real Madrid last season's turnover reached 6.2 billion euros, KPMG statistics of the commercial value of 2.976 billion euros, the world's only Manchester United; On the contrary, the ancestral home after the completion of the new ,
Revenue rose steadily, but with a turnover of about 387 million euros and a commercial value of 1,218 million euros last quarter, it ranked 9th in Europe, still lower than Arsenal's Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelyabinsk and Liverpool. Banknotes, high natural attraction, just as wage earners like to join the giant business, ""transfer market"" Projected Real Madrid final election is worth a total of 760 million euros, the ancestral record of only 450 million euros, or even inferior to the youth class Tottenham. ""It's hard to deny Real Madrid's beckoning."" Ai Hua Road Morata changed the cast of arms to Real Madrid for last summer's bid to get more anger, and the result was that the BBC squashed onto the bench . Husband Fu Hiddenstar Honest Honest truth, the wave is always round, more money, more stars and not necessarily win the wave. There are not many ancestral gods in the ancestral land, buffon is 40-year-old god of the gods, there are newcomers Paul Dybala (Dybala) on the front, but the key figure should be the end of quarter god Daniel (Dani). The Brazilian champion will be born champion, played 3 times for the European Union has won, with the experience of Sevier, a total of 13 qualifying finals, of which 12 cup. When he left the party, he told Barcelona that he ""will surely catch me in the EU."" Soldiers will not move, Al-Korolyi (Allergi) and Shidan players no match for the era, but after the teachings the same way, the same variable tactics to take office at the beginning also been excused, gain recognition step by step. Although the ancestral mark was seen low line, but nearly all three unbeaten confrontation, Shi Dan wore white and black zebra clothing, had Percigold with Koli Li played a, when in 1996 September, two yellow and one red were Unfortunately left unpleasant memories. Every contest, foreign gambling companies will offer a wide variety of discounts. For instance, Shidan's performance of ""World Cup"" in 2006 is 500 times as high as that of Materazzi, Lee,
Be silly! Other interesting handicaps, C Lang face the moth once again after the European Cup final, the odds of 100 times; Blatter suddenly appeared Cardiff Millennium Stadium, up to 1000 times.

根据美国联邦储备理事会(FED/美联储)周三发布的上次货币政策会议记录，多数美联储决策者认为，只要经济数据保持强劲，就应该在今年晚些时候采取措施，开始缩减规模达4.5万亿美元的资产负债表。美联储公布的3月14日至15日会议记录还显示出，利率制定委员会对是否逐渐减少，抑或一次性全面停止再投资进行了广泛的讨论。美联储在上次会议上以九票赞同一票反对决定升息。""如果经济表现仍和预期一致，绝大多数与会者预计将继续逐渐上调联邦基金利率，并认为今年晚些时候改变委员会的再投资政策是合适的，""美联储在会议记录中称。会议记录发布后，美国公债收益率一度大涨，但之后扭转走势。美元短暂下滑，而美股由升转跌。金融危机后，美联储以前所未有的规模购买公债和抵押贷款支持证券，以帮助利率维持在低水平，从而刺激就业和经济成长。美联储决策者之前曾暗示，一旦升息""进行了一段时间后""，将通过债券到期后不再进行再投资，允许债券自然到期来实现缩表计划。""美联储12月货币政策会议预计是最可能开始缩表的日期。""Capital

","""Focus"" Most Fed Policymakers Should Start Reducing Balance Sheet ""Later This Year"" - Minutes Reuters Washington April 5 -
According to the minutes of the last monetary policy meeting released by the UNION BANK OF TAIWAN RESERVING BOARD (FED / FED) on Wednesday, most Fed policymakers believe that as long as economic data stays strong, steps should be taken later this year to begin scaling back 4.5 trillion US dollars in the balance sheet. The minutes released by the Federal Reserve from March 14 to March 15 also showed that the interest rate setting committee held extensive discussions on whether to gradually reduce or stop the reinvestment once and for all. At the last meeting, the Fed decided to raise interest rates with nine votes in favor. ""If the economic performance is still in line with expectations, the vast majority of participants are expected to continue to gradually raise the UNION BANK OF TAIWAN fund rate and think it is appropriate to change the Commission's reinvestment policy later this year,"" the Fed said in the minutes. After the minutes were released, the yield on U.S. bonds rose sharply, but then reversed the trend. The dollar fell briefly, while the US stock rose from fall to finish. After the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve bought treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities on an unprecedented scale to help keep interest rates low and stimulate employment and economic growth. The Fed's policymakers had previously hinted that once the rate hike was ""over time,"" the plan would be shortened by no longer reinvesting the bond once it matures, allowing the bond to naturally expire. ""The Fed's December monetary policy meeting is expected to be the date most likely to begin narrowing."" Capital
Economics chief US analyst Paul
Ashworth said after the minutes were released. The Fed raised its target rate target range to 0.75-1% at the March meeting, raising interest rates for the second time in three months and hoping to raise interest rates twice this year. According to the minutes of the meeting, the timing of almost all policy makers agreeing to change their balance sheets depends on their economic and financial conditions and generally tends to gradually reduce or stop their investments in U.S. bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The idea of ​​a gradual reduction of reinvestment is considered less likely to trigger financial market volatility and a one-stop reinvestment ""is generally perceived as more easily communicated to the outside world and may allow the balance sheet to normalize more quickly."" It was agreed that the balance sheet should be gradually and systematically reduced. Almost all policymakers said that any policy change ""should be communicated to the public long before it actually changes."" ** Economic Upside Risks ** Earlier this week, New York Fed President Dudley said that measures to normalize the balance sheet would tighten financial markets and could affect the rate hike. The minutes of the minutes before the release of the New York Fed survey show Wall Street banks do not expect the Fed to change its balance sheet until 2018. In addition, according to minutes, policymakers seem to think the economy is upside risk but disagree with how far the Fed will reach its 2% inflation target this year. In a March policy statement, the Fed said the inflation target was ""symmetrical,"" suggesting that inflation may have the potential to allow inflation to temporarily exceed 2% for the time being. For the first time, the Fed also released a so-called ""pie chart"" along with the minutes to show the degree of uncertainty about the quarterly economic forecast. (For the first time the Federal Reserve fan chart, click
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20170315.pdf
) The Federal Reserve said the economic forecast is very uncertain. The Fed's next policy meeting will be held May 2-3, and investors are expecting another rate hike at the June meeting.

如果你曾经去过有名人饭堂之称、位于上环的Room28意大利餐厅，除了你可能会遇上一众明星，例如甄子丹、徐子珊、邓紫棋、欧阳震华之外，你还会见到餐厅老闆娘Jannine。
这位人称美魔女的妈妈，身形高䠷、皮肤白滑，更一身潮人的打扮，怎也估不到她今年已50岁，还有一对分别29岁及27岁的仔女，究竟有甚麽保养心得呢？
Jannine说：「其实我很少做运动，又没有特别戒口，只是每天起床会饮一杯柠檬水，仅此而已。不过可能我为人乐观，经常充满正能量，或许这就是保持年轻的秘诀吧！」
现时Jannine每天都要返餐厅，工作接近十几小时，非常忙碌。身为母亲要照顾家庭又同时打理餐厅，会否觉得吃力？「其实餐厅的工作时间好长，节日又没有假期，很难经常陪伴子女，小时候他们都有投诉的。」
Jannine说更试过发生不快事件，「记得某天朋友约我食饭，我就带同阿女一起去，怎知她一边食一边扁嘴，原来因为阿女话多了个陌生人，令我与她没有独处时间。」所以待两个仔女长大后，Jannine便索性叫他们在餐厅一边帮手一边享受家庭乐，争取见面时间。仔女有正职
閒时回舖帮手
仔仔Mark今年29岁，是一位时装设计师，曾为邓紫棋演唱会设计服饰；囡囡Joyce是无綫《东将西望》主持人，他们二人各有正职，但就非常孝顺，閒时都会到Room28工作，他们在餐厅更有不同的岗位。
Joyce说：「我自己很喜欢食嘢，所以我经常会去不同的餐厅食饭，有时当我取得灵感，就会同妈妈商量，一起设计新菜式。而且我经常来这里开餐，我会尝试不同的菜式，之后会给一些意见，希望可以作改进。」
至于Mark就主要做宣传工作，「我会负责PR及Marketing，有时更会在餐厅招呼客人，以及会介绍朋友来食饭。」Jannine说试过有女食客主动要求跟Mark拍照，更笑言Mark如小鲜肉一般，深受女食客欢迎。
两兄妺偶尔回舖帮手，平日由妈妈一手一脚打理，Jannine自言香港经营餐厅相当困难。「尤其我们这些独立的小餐厅，供应商差不多每周都加价，人工贵及很难请人，就算你以高价请到员工，又未必真的帮到你手，还有租金又愈来愈贵，种种加起上来，真的是艰苦经营。」她更说食店要生存，最重要是食物水准好，累积口碑吸引更多食客。母亲节海鲜菜
今年母亲节Jannine要返工，一对仔女如何同妈妈庆祝呢？Joyce说：「平日餐厅会于周日休息，但这天会照常营业，我们会一齐到餐厅替妈妈庆祝，顺便可以帮手。」Jannine笑言母亲节可以同仔仔囡囡一起度过，已经是最好的礼物了！
餐厅今年推出多款母亲节套餐，其中有不少海鲜菜式，Jannine说除了因海鲜是餐厅主打项目之一，更因很多女士都喜欢食海鲜。套餐中便有龙虾意大利饭、焗蟹盖、小龙虾伴海胆等等。必食的是Jannine至爱的焗蟹盖，用新鲜花蟹以人手拆肉再加入香料焗香，入口鲜味无穷，还吃到啖啖蟹肉。
还有餐厅最闻名的Semifreddo这款冻甜品，主要以糖、蛋及忌廉等造成。Jannine每次都会把Semifreddo配衬不同的装饰品，母亲节当天便会用上漂亮的洋娃娃，靓靓的外表一定能讨母亲大人的欢心。
其实不只在母亲节，餐厅平日餐牌中，也有令人惊喜的菜式，如西班牙黑毛猪扒，更是店子的镇店菜式之一，特色是用上自家製的薑汁黑醋，跟猪扒十分对味；还有差不多每枱都必叫的酥皮龙虾汤，以大量海鲜及龙虾熬煮而成，入口鲜味到不得了，怪不得明星食客都讚不绝口。

Second, the rebound in commodity prices last year, gold as a hedging tool, so China International Capital Corporation Limited Gold also hi profit, forecasted 2016 annual results or by 323% or so. Shandong Gold Mining Co.,Ltd. is also expected to double its sales in 2016 to 1.5 times. However, due to the fluctuation in commodity prices, there were also a lot of losses. SINOFERT HOLDINGS LIMITED reported a significant loss last year as a result of the drop in profit margin of fertilizer products last year and provision for long-term equity investments. China First Heavy Industries (China First Heavy Industries), the China China Shipbuilding Industry Company Limited, posted a profit warning yesterday after losing 3 months of weak sales. As a result, losses of up to 5.7 billion huge; as the net profit of the last two fiscal years consecutive negative, or be delisted risk warning, how many reflect the industrial situation is not good. Fourth, the growth is quite dependent on real estate sales last year, the Ministry of Finance data released yesterday let this brick economic reality more clearly highlight the ── real estate deed tax 430 billion yuan last year, an increase of 10.3%; 421.2 billion yuan of land value-added tax, rose 9.9%; property taxes 2221 Billion yuan, up 8.3%; accounting for a larger share of the transfer of state-owned land use rights amounted to 3745700000000 yuan, an increase of 15.1%.

I0d6454d023a311e7b89b823950a2a4a3.1C,"大湾区概念 吼深圳国际资料提供:
上周国务院总理李克强重申粤港澳大湾区发展，令市场对其未来发展抱满憧憬，滙丰环球投资管理高级市场策略师谭慧敏对于近期两个瞩目区域概念，表示大湾区的发展将较雄安新区更快更着重质素。
「其实大湾与雄安概念并不是一项新事物，规划方向较似将以往京津冀与珠三角规划的延伸。于政策未出台前，其实可预期相关区域会有一定发展。加上今年中国将会用更多财政政策稳定经济，基建相关成为刺激经济的一大重点。」谭慧敏指，未来大湾区发展建设，将以提高居民的生活质素，具增值性的产业为主。内房方面，谭慧敏认为区内二、三綫城市可受概念带动，刺激成交以令库存情况更理想，可吼区内拥二綫城市土地的内房企业。（有关大湾区内房概念分析，详见另文
--龙光、深控 为大湾区内房之选）海陆运输成区内发展趋势
其实粤港澳大湾区除了是将珠三角经济带概念深化外，亦是国家对外开放的其中一个重要窗口。根据WIND数据显示，目前粤港澳大湾区单以GDP计与世界三大湾区相比并不逊色，惟区内产业分布上，其馀三区全部第三产业均逾8成以上，而粤港澳大湾区只有约6成多。广发証券报告指，若粤港澳大湾区要与世界三大湾区比肩，其发展趋势亦会类似，故根据另外三区的经验，交通运输、港口及地产为主要受益产业链。
国家早于2009年，已有意于2020年前在珠三角地区内发展一小时交通圈，而目前于大湾区发展规划提出下，未来交通规划投资预计亦将会展开。而国家交通运输部发言人吴春耕于上月底再次强调，粤港澳交通领域的互联互通十分重要。目前区内如城轨铁路互通以及跨珠江通道建设亦陆续展开。
除了陆路以外，于海路物流上，大湾区概念亦可与一带一路产生战略协同效应。广发証券指区内主要港口共有6个，以各港口功能看，大多数均以集中箱运输为主，出现分工定位不明确以及相互竞争的情况，由于大湾区发展以相互融合为主，未来各港口或参考东京湾规划，有明确等级及定位分工以加强效率。东北证券亦指，由于目前区内港口的股权分散，未来有区内港口潜在整合重组的可能。深圳国际前海地吸引
深圳国际（00152）两大业务分别为收费公路以及物流业务，公司16年业绩收入录77.9亿港元，同比15.6%，不过由于公司于15年度有部分非经常性盈利影响，加上旗下部分公路与深圳市政府签署的调整收费及补偿协议共有计提利息成本5.3亿元人民币，令公司淨利润同比倒退3.8%，录21.2亿港元，惟以核心业务计算，纯利同比增55%。
摩根士丹利于上月底发表报告指，确信深圳国际股价将于30日内上升，当中因为公司正逐步释放前海地皮的价值，其估计公司所拥的前海地皮价值171亿港元，相当于当时77%深圳国际市值，故上调其目标价19%。而大湾区概念的憧憬相当可进一步刺激地皮价值，令公司估值继续有上望空间。
另一方面，公司的本业亦受惠大湾区发展，公司港口业务录5.3亿元收入，同比增185%，业绩中指增长主要由供应链管理服务业务的带动。中银国际报告指，集团的旗下的物流圈业务目前虽仍处于培育阶段，需要2至3年时间提高营运效率，公司去年有33.1万平方米物流圈在营运阶段，今年计划将再开多23万平方米的物流圈。由于大湾区未来有望成为海上丝绸之路的窗口，集团目前积极发展物流圈及港口业务成未来增长潜力。
综合彭博券商预测，深圳国际2017及18年每股盈利分别增长3.4%及7.8%，对应PE为11.4倍及10.6倍。其中摩根士丹利看法最牛，目标价给予19.25元，瑞信目标价为15.2元。公司自3月底业绩发布后股价开始扬升，而大湾区概念出场后再以大阳烛突破，建议于12.8元买入，目标价为15.5元，跌穿12元止蚀。

","Greater Bay Area Concept SHENZHEN INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED Information provided by:
Last week Premier Li Keqiang reiterated the development of the Greater Bay Area in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macau and Hong Kong to make the market full of hope for its future development. HSBC Global Markets senior strategist Tam Wai Man has expressed his concern about the recent two notions of regional development, saying that the development of the Tai Wan District will be more secure New District faster and more emphasis on quality.
""In fact, the concept of"" Tai Wan and Cheung An ""is not a new thing. The planning direction is more like an extension of the previous plans for Beijing, Tianjin and the PRD. Before the promulgation of the policy, it is actually expected that there will be some developments in the relevant areas. China will stabilize its economy with more fiscal policies and infrastructure-related issues will become a major stimulus for the economy. ""Tan Huimin said that in the future, the development and construction of the Tai Wan area will be based on industries that enhance the quality of life of the residents and add value. Insider, Tan Huimin that the second and third tier cities in the region can be driven by the concept to stimulate the transaction to make the inventory more satisfactory, can roar area with second-tier cities within the housing business. (For a more in-depth analysis of the interior concept of the Tai Wan District, please refer to the separate article
- Long, deep control of the selected area within the Tai Wan District) Sea and land transport into the development trend in the region
In fact, apart from deepening the concept of the Pearl River Delta Economic Belt, the Tai Wan District of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau is also one of the important windows for the country's opening to the outside world. According to the WIND data, at present, the single-GDP statistics of the Tai Wan District of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau is not inferior to that of the three major Bay areas in the world. However, the distribution of industries in the three districts in the region is over 80% Tai Wan District, Hong Kong and Macau only about 60%. GF Securities reported that if the Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and Tai Wan areas are to shoulder the same footing as the three major Bay areas in the world, their development trends will be similar. Therefore, based on the experience of the other three districts, transportation, ports and real estate are the major beneficiary industrial chains.
As early as 2009, the state has already intended to develop an hour-long traffic circle in the PRD by 2020. At present, under the development planning of the Tai Wan District, the investment in transport planning for the future is expected to start. Wu Chun-peng, spokesman for the State Ministry of Transport, stressed at the end of last month that the connectivity in the transport sector between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Maucao is very important. At present, inter-city rail interchanges and cross-Pearl River corridors are also being built in the region.
Apart from land transport, the concept of ""Tai Wan"" can also generate strategic synergies with Belt and Road on the logistics of the sea. GF Securities refers to a total of 6 major ports in the region. Judging from the port functions, most of them are mainly concentrated container shipping. The division of labor is uncertain and competing. Since the development of the Tai Wan District is dominated by mutual merging, the future For each port or with reference to the Tokyo Bay Project, there is a clear hierarchy and a clear division of labor to enhance efficiency. Northeast Securities Co.,Ltd. also said potential consolidation and reorganization of ports in the region is possible in the future due to the decentralized shareholdings in the ports in the region. SHENZHEN INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED Attraction in Haiti
 SHENZHEN INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED (00152), the toll road and logistics business respectively, recorded a 16-year revenue of HK $ 7.79 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 15.6%. However, due to some non-recurring profitability of the Company in FY15, The toll adjustment and compensation agreement signed by the Shenzhen Municipal Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government provided a total cost of interest of RMB530 million, reversing the Company's net profit by 3.8% YoY and recording HK $ 2.12bn. However, net profit for the core business increased by 55% YoY.
Morgan Stanley said in a report late last month that it believes the share price of SHENZHEN INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED will rise within 30 days as the company is gradually releasing the value of its former Haiti land and is estimated to have a value of HK $ 17.1 billion in Qianhai land owned by the company, At that time 77% SHENZHEN INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED market value, it raised its target price of 19%. The vision of the Tai Wan District concept can further stimulate the value of the land so that the valuation of the Company will continue to have room for improvement.
On the other hand, the Company's business also benefited from the development of the Tai Wan District. The Company recorded a revenue of $ 530 million from its port business, up 185% over the same period of last year. The growth in the performance of the middle market was mainly driven by the supply chain management services business. The BOCI report states that while the Group's logistics circle business is still under development at present, it will take 2-3 years to improve operational efficiency. Last year, the company's 331,000 square meters logistics circle was operating during this year and plans to open 230,000 more this year Square meter logistics circle. As the future of Tai Wan District is expected to become a window to the Silk Road on the sea, the Group is now actively developing its logistics and port business into future growth potential.
Based on Bloomberg estimates, SHENZHEN INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED increased its FYE and FY18 earnings by 3.4% and 7.8% respectively, to 11.4x and 10.6x PE. Which Morgan Stanley most cattle, the target price of 19.25 yuan to give, Credit Suisse target price of 15.2 yuan. Since the announcement of the Company's performance at the end of March, the share price has started to rise.

年金（Annuity）是保险公司就不同人士的退休需要，所推出的理财产品之一，除了按揭证券公司准备明年推出的「终身年金计划」外，市面上也有多间保险公司提供年金产品，包括友邦的「年金宝」、宏利的「宏悦年金」、美国万通的「目标必达终身年金宝」，以及滙丰人寿的「盈达年金」等等，各有特色（见表四）。一、年金利率保证
市面上的年金计划，标榜每年年金率有3厘或4厘以上，但大多属非保证回报，主要受投资表现所左右。
有保险公司提供年金利率保证，好处是投保人可以有稳定的预算。例如美国万通的「目标必达终身年金宝」，保单生效满15年或以上，年金利率保证至少3%。
又例如宏利的「宏悦年金」，投保人可预先缴付第2年的保费，便可享首年4.5%之保证年利率。二、年金每年递增
一些年金计划，除了提供定额终身年金，亦有提供递增终身年金，即每年或每两年分派的年金金额会递增，好处是可以追上通胀，例如宏利的「宏悦年金」，年金保证按年递增3%。
又例如美国万通的「目标必达终身年金宝」，共有7款年金计划选择，当中可选递增终身年金计划，年金每两年递增5%。三、终身及非终身
年金计划有终身及非终身之分，按揭证券公司的「终身年金计划」，属于终身派发，投保人不用担心倘长命百岁会不够钱用的问题。
市面上也有一些年金计划属于终身派发，例如美国万通的「目标必达终身年金宝」，终身派发，不设置年龄限制。
保险公司提供的年金计划，以非终身较普遍，例如友邦的「年金宝」，最多派至110岁；宏利的「宏悦年金」，最多派至100岁。滙丰人寿的「盈达年金」，最多派20年，即投保人开始取用年金后，要预算20年后便会结束。四、联合年金领取
受保人愈长寿，所得年金自然愈多，所以，年金计划是一种「赌长命」的保障。
然而，若供款人忧虑一旦自己不长命，「太早走」的话，便会蚀章，那麽，他可以考虑选择有联合年金领取人的计划，即供款人身故后，仍可继续由其配偶或亲人收取终身年金，此举好处是可以保障家人。
例如美国万通的「目标必达终身年金宝」，提供了两项选择；其一是若受保人于保证期内身故，则计划会继续派发年金予指定受益人，直至保证期终结为止；其二是受保人可与配偶共享100%年金，于其中一人身故后，另一人亦可无限期继续收取三分之二年金金额，直至百年归老。

","Market Annuity Competition Information provided by:
Annuity is one of the wealth management products launched by insurance companies on the retirement needs of different people. Apart from the ""Lifetime Annuity Scheme"" to be launched by the HKMC in the coming year, there are also a number of insurance companies offering annuity products on the market, including the AIA Group Limited's ""KINPO ELECTRONICS, INC."", Manulife's ""Wang Yue Annuity Fund"", the United States Wantong's ""Target Indebtedness KINPO ELECTRONICS, INC."", And HSBC Life's ""EEDA Annuity Fund,"" etc. Distinctive (see Table 4). First, annuity rate guarantee
The annuity scheme on the market, which advertises an annual annuity rate of 3% or above, is mostly non-guaranteed and is mainly driven by the performance of the investment.
An insurance company to provide annuity rate guarantee, the advantage is that policyholders can have a stable budget. For example, Metrohm's ""Lifetime KINPO ELECTRONICS, INC."" Should be valid for 15 years or more, with an annual guaranteed rate of at least 3%.
Another example is Honglei's ""Wyeth Annuity,"" which allows the policyholders to pay a premium of 2 years in advance to enjoy a guaranteed annual interest rate of 4.5% for the first year. Second, annuity increases each year
Some annuity plans, in addition to providing fixed life annuities, provide incremental life annuities. That is, annual annuities or biennial annuities will increase in amount. The benefits are that they can catch up with inflation. For example, ""Hong Yue Annuities Annuities"" Increases by 3%.
Another example is the United States Wantong's ""target will be bound to life KINPO ELECTRONICS, INC."", A total of seven annuity plan options, including an optional incremental life annuity plan, annuity every 5 years, an increase of 5%. Third, life and non-life
Annuity plans are life-long and non-lifelong. The ""Lifetime Annuity Scheme"" of the HKMC is all-inclusive. The policyholders do not have to worry about the problem of losing money if they are 100 years old.
There are also some annuity plans on the market that are distributed for life. For example, Metrohm's Lifetime KINPO ELECTRONICS, INC. Is distributed for life and no age limit is set.
Annuity plans offered by insurance companies are non-permanent. For example, ""KINPO ELECTRONICS, INC."" Of AIA Group Limited can be sent up to 110 years old. Hongli's ""Wyeth Annuity"" can be sent up to 100 years at most. HSBC Life's ""Earnings Annuity"" can be sent for up to 20 years. That is, after the insured person starts to use the annuity, he will have to budget 20 years later. Fourth, the union annuity receive
The longer the life of the insured person, the more naturally the annuity will be derived. Therefore, the annuity plan is a guarantee of long-term survival.
However, if the contributor fears that if he or she does not make a long-term living and will ""go too early"", then he may wish to eclipse the plan. Then he may consider choosing a scheme with a united annuity recipient, that is, he can continue after the contributor dies The benefit of getting a life annuity from a spouse or loved one is to protect the family.
For example, Metrohm's Lifetime KINPO ELECTRONICS, INC. Offers a choice of two options. One is that if the insured dies in the guarantee period, the plan will continue to distribute the annuity to the designated beneficiaries until The second is that the insured person can share 100% of the annuity with his spouse. After one of them dies, the other person may continue indefinitely the amount of two-thirds of the annuity until one hundred years.",市面年金大比拼,Not Reuters,02:00PM 14 Apr 2016,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I0d6b80c023a311e78033cfdba34663e0.1C.html

英国消费者支出可能正在浮现退欧公投后的第一道裂痕，而消费者支出是该国经济的基石。一连串悲观的零售销售调查，暗示英国家庭开始感受到通胀压力。去年6月23日公投决定退出欧盟后，英国经济表现超乎预期，2016年增速快于任何大型发达经济体。但接受路透调查的分析师认为，今年经济将明显放缓，主要因为英镑兑美元大跌近20%造成的物价上涨压力，料将削弱消费者支出。多项衡量零售销售的指标目前都直指同一个方向，这可能是成长放缓效应开始显现的初步迹象。这些零售销售指标各月可能波动较大，而且有时互相矛盾英国零售业联盟(BRC)周二公布最新的报告显示，11月至1月期间以现金计的零售销售，创下2008/2009年来同期最慢增速，当时英国经济正处于金融危机后的低谷。英国工业联盟(CBI)的1月零售销售差值创下1983年有记录以来最大的单月降幅[nL4S1FG3CV]；欧盟执委会的一项零售业调查与12月的正式数据也都走弱。英国央行官员将检视这些数据，以找寻理据支持他们对家庭支出势将弱于上年的观点，尽管央行的部分预测已没有英退公投后那么悲观。英国央行总裁卡尼上周承认，消费者支出的力度让央行感到惊讶。就业市场强劲和信贷成本低廉可能是带动消费支出的原因。""今年随着时间的推移，这种态势将开始受到考验。""他在英国央行上周四公布政策决议后的记者会说，会上他还强调薪资前景将是关键。对多数经济分析师来说，唯一的问题是未来几个月消费支出趋弱的程度，此前消费支出是受薪资增长的驱动，但不久后通胀激升就会盖过薪资增长。消费者可能已提前支出，以防未来物价开始上涨，或是利用目前利率在纪录低位的机会借款。这都增添了经济状况的疑虑。""我认为值得一提的是，这些全都应让我对今年情况感到相对悲观。""伦敦政经学院教授宾恩上周在汤森路透主办的Fathom

","Britain's economy: the first post-Brexit economic pillar consumer spending cracked Reuters London February 7 -
UK consumer spending may be emerging as the first crack after the Brexit vote, with consumer spending the cornerstone of the country's economy. A series of pessimistic retail sales survey, suggesting that British families began to feel the inflationary pressure. After the referendum on June 23 last year decided to withdraw from the European Union, the British economy was outperforming and its growth in 2016 was faster than that of any large developed economy. However, Reuters surveyed analysts believe that this year the economy will slow down significantly, mainly due to the pound sterling against the US dollar plummeted nearly 20% of the pressure caused by rising prices, is expected to weaken consumer spending. A number of indicators measuring retail sales are now pointing in the same direction, which may be the first signs of a slowdown in growth. These retail sales indicators may fluctuate month by month, and sometimes contradict each other. The latest report released Tuesday by the British Retail Federation (BRC) shows retail sales in cash for the period from November to January, the slowest for the same period of 2008/2009 Growth, when the British economy is in the doldrums after the financial crisis. The January retail sales gap of the British Industrial Coalition (CBI) hit its largest single-month drop since recordkeeping in 1983; a retail survey by the European Commission and official data for December all weakened. Bank of England officials will examine the data to find evidence that they support their spending on the home weaker than the previous year's view, although the central bank's part of the forecast has been less pessimistic after the referendum. Bank of England Governor Carney admitted last week that the strength of consumer spending surprised the central bank. Strong job market and low credit costs may be the reason driving consumer spending. ""This trend will start to get tested this year as time goes by."" His press conference following a Bank of England decision to announce policy on Thursday said he also stressed that the payroll outlook will be key. For most economists, the only issue is the extent to which consumer spending has weakened over the coming months, after consumer spending was driven by salary increases but soon after rising inflation would have overshadowed wage growth. Consumers may have spent ahead of time to prevent future price increases from beginning to end, or borrowing at current record low rates. All this adds to the suspicion of the economy. ""I think it is worth mentioning that all of these should make me feel relatively pessimistic about the situation this year."" Fathom, a professor at the London School of Economics who was sponsored by Thompson Reuters last week,
Consulting's monetary policy forum said. Binnen served as the Bank of England vice president. Almost no doubt consumers are starting to worry about rising prices. Google Google
Trends data showed that the term ""inflation"" hit the top of search engine hotspot in the past five years earlier this year; consumer-confidence surveys by data firm Markit and the European Commission also showed concerns about inflation are rising. BRC research and market research firm Kantar
Worldpanel supermarket data released on Tuesday also showed that consumers now have to buy more necessities to pay more money, suggesting that the discretionary spending may be reduced soon. ""Retail sales were strong last fall, preventing GDP growth from slowing after the referendum, but that seems to reflect investors giving up ahead of 2017 as prices are expected to rise."" Pantheon

Macron）于第二轮投票可以撼赢马琳勒庞（Marine Le
Pen），各方政治力量联合阻止马琳勒庞入主爱丽舍宫，大家都相信她会像其老爸一样被围攻，老勒庞2002年曾意外闯进总统大选次轮投票，惟遭到各方杯葛，最终大败收场。金融市场在首轮投票后，风险胃纳大增，资金回流风险资产包括亚股，之前有资金淨流出避险，但本周3个交易天，亚洲几个市场都见颇劲的资金回流。南韩股市有外资淨买盘11.67亿美元，台股9.25亿美元，印尼股市2.41亿美元，其他有登记外资进出流量的股市都有不同程度的淨流入，以此引伸，港股市场也有外资加注。欧民粹未成气候
外资回流亚股去年6月，英国脱欧公投结果爆大冷，民众决定脱欧，再到11月美国总统大选，特朗普出乎意料地入主白宫，投资者不禁担心民粹主义席捲全球。然而，今年3月份的荷兰大选及是次法国总统大选，结果都反映民粹派在欧洲似乎未能遍地开花，建制派仍有驾驭之力。德国极右派政党另类选择党内讧，党魁早前决定不会带领该党参与大选，欧洲民粹主义风险暂消，起码要等到明年夏季意大利大选时才有机会捲土重来。环球经济复甦势头不俗，经济数据普遍向好，企业盈利增长佳，均支撑环球股市上扬。从美银美林的环球金融压力指数走势看【图1】，金融市场正在压力纾缓期。金融海啸之初是压力的高峰期，其后在各国央行及政府发力维持增长后，压力纾缓下来。到2010年至2012年，欧债危机爆发，压力指数进入另一次上升期。之后欧央行全力扑火，行长德拉吉拍心口包起所有风险，一切又回稳。到2015年下半年至2016年初，中国债务爆煲论甚嚣尘上，压力又回升。去年2月之后，指数开始进入另一次下行周期，应该可以延续至今年底甚至明年上半年，中间会有起落，但大趋势仍是向好。大路多人走

The Hang Seng Index retreated 122 points to close at 24,578 points yesterday, driven by gambling stocks, with a market turnover of 78.6 billion yuan.

After the first round of voting in the financial market, the risk appetite has risen sharply. The risk-return assets include sub-shares. There was a net outflow of funds before the financial markets returned. However, in the three trading days this week, several markets in Asia saw substantial return of capital. South Korea's stock markets have net foreign buying of 1.167 billion U.S. dollars, Taiwan stocks of 9.25 billion U.S. dollars and Indonesian stock markets of 241 million U.S. dollars. Other stocks with registered foreign capital inflows and outflows have different degrees of net inflows. As a result, South Korea's stock market has raised foreign funds.

Trump unexpectedly entered the White House. Investors can not help but worry that populism is sweeping the globe. However, both the Dutch presidential election in March this year and the French presidential election this time reflect the fact that the Narodniks appear to have failed to blossom all over Europe and that the constructions still have the power to control. Germany's far-right party has opted for an alternative party election. The leader earlier decided not to lead the party in the general election. European populist risk was resumed, at least until next summer's Italian presidential election.

The beginning of the financial tsunami was the peak of the pressure. Afterwards, the pressure was relieved after central banks and governments in various countries made efforts to maintain growth. From 2010 to 2012, the debt crisis in Europe broke out and the stress index entered another period of rise. After the European Central Bank fully engaged in the fire, Governor Draghie heart wrapped all risks, everything stabilized. From the second half of 2015 to the beginning of 2016, the pressure on China's debt explosion is rampant and pressure is on the rise again. After February last year, the index started to enter another downward cycle. It should last until the end of this year or even the first half of next year.

It is not easy for fund managers to make choices. . When everyone in the second half of the year is under speculation, he must be careful.

The three are very similar. Of course, the fluctuation of GALAXY ENTERTAINMENT GROUP LIMITED and CHOW TAI FOOK JEWELERY GROUP LIMITED is relatively large, supporting the substantial rise of the share prices of the three parties and the Chinese consumers.

","U.S.-China Relationship: US Tax Cut Is Struggling to Stir Up Tax War and Uprising International Tax Order - People's Daily Reuters BEIJING, April 28 - In response to the U.S. government's unprecedented announcement on tax reform, -
The People's Daily published a commentary on Friday arguing that in the eyes of other countries, tax cuts in the United States are actually provoking a tax war; in doing so, it would plunge the international tax order into disarray and export-oriented countries that would not be able to engage in some tax competition Directly damaged. The article entitled Wei Liang, entitled ""The United States tax reform, who is the winner,"" the commentary said that in response, some powerful countries will join the competition, or race to cut taxes, or be beggarments, or to create a tax haven. At present, this sign has already taken shape in developed countries such as Britain and France. ""This will not only plunge the international tax order into chaos, but will also diminish the vicious competition in international tax revenue such as the so-called"" BEEP action plan ""under the framework of coordinated international economic policies such as the G20. The article said. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed a drastic reduction of the tax rate on repatriation of overseas profits to enterprises and enterprises. Congressional Republicans mostly support the plan, but the plan is seen as just the first move. [nL4T1HY6O5] People's Daily article pointed out that, in the case of the U.S. government, huge fiscal reduction will inevitably occur. According to estimates by a number of agencies, such a tax reform will allow the U.S. government to reduce its fiscal revenue by 2-6 trillion U.S. dollars over the next 10 years. This is not a big risk for a U.S. government that has a debt-ridden ceiling that has to be backed up by a debt. At the same time, the risks of participating in the U.S. government-led investment projects have also increased. In the future, the economic construction of the United States will not only reduce tax, but also need to expand its infrastructure to carry out civilized construction. In the meantime, it is more economical to spend less on the one hand and on the other hand to attract private investors to invest in infrastructure. What money is doing is both a problem and a risk. If the real economic investment rate in the United States is still weak and the profit margin is not high, financial transactions such as speculation are still very profitable. Enterprises will repurchase shares to decorate the stock price, and other investors will also follow suit. Tax relief will save money like a wide period, pushing up the financial bubble. In this way, the tax reform will not only fail, but may also become a trigger for systemic financial risks.
Overall, the U.S. tax reform program, even if successfully passed by the National Assembly, will need to guide and make good use of the money in the future. At the same time, it will coordinate international tax co-ordination with other countries to prevent mutual harm and endanger the global economy ""Said the article. The People's Daily also published another analysis article on the same day saying that this ambitious tax relief plan benefited the richest people, the middle class and Wall Street. However, the uncertainty about this tax relief plan is also obvious. If the tax cuts will still be to reduce the budget, increase the cost of foreign debt, I am afraid will be opposed by the American people. China's State Council executive meeting on Wednesday decided to introduce further tax cuts and is expected to reduce the tax burden on various market entities this year by more than 380 billion yuan. This will include continuing to push forward the reform of the business camp and simplifying the structure of the VAT tax rate. Starting from July 1 , Reducing the VAT rate from fourth gear to 17%, third gear 11% and 6% and reducing the VAT rate of agricultural products and natural gas from 13% to 11%.

《经济通通讯社记者黄健臻１６日报道》中国白银（００８１５）早前完成收购上海华通铂银交易市场，白银生产企业与交易所联合起来，华通铂银交易市场总裁张英华接受本通讯社访问时表示，收购可以把上游及下游中端的产业链接合起来，华通的平台可以让贸易商、生产商及中间用户达成更有效率的交易，而且去年已经为集团贡献８０００万元人民币的淨利润。
他提到，中国白银收购公司的原因，很大程度因为华通拥有的白银定价权，公司是全中国第一家白银交易所，拥有国内现货白银的定价权，通过中国白银网、微信的平台，每日早上发布白银定盘价，下午就公布白银结算价，所有国内最大的矿山、冶炼场及贸易商都会採用这个价格作现货结算，已经持续十多年。
他指出，收购后更升级现有交易模型，由以前只有１０个报价会员，增至现时的２６个报价会员，而且包括大冶、豫光等一些国内大型冶炼场，定价将更有代表性。＊公司深入开拓白银相关服务＊
副总裁孙里补充，报价会员只会稳定在现有水平，但就希望引入更多参与者，可以採用公司的报价，让定价权更完善，现时着眼将定价权的衍生价格，吸纳更多专业金融及合格机构投资者参与。
他指出，公司亦会深入开拓白银相关服务，例如货物融通、供应链融资服务等，亦会增加其他稀有金属交易产品。
至于扩大国际影响力方面，张英华表示，现在伦敦的白银价格，因为银行操纵问题，在国际的影响力及流动性开始减弱，希望进一步扩大公司的定价权影响力，服务国内实体经济。＊对商品交易管控增，对业务无影响＊
他解释，以往伦敦白银价格先郁动，国内白银价格就会跟随波动，但现在情况有些改变，有时中国白银价格显着波动，亦会影响国际白银价格，开始出现互动过程。
张英华提及内地对商品交易市场管控增加，认为对现有公司业务没有影响。近期客户参与度提升，会员及现货商的交易需求增加。他指出，之前不同交易所的质素参差不齐，有些交易所没有仓库，亦可以扮演成现货交易市场。
他强调，公司从开业起已经以现货交易为基础，并得到政府及监管机构认可，希望市场经过整顿，让规范的交易所有更大的生存空间，竞争力可以更强。他提到，政府希望提升贵金属「实」的需要，并减少「虚」的需求，不是鼓励购买纸张合约，而是购买白银银条或製品。

据上海证券报周一报导，截至今日，公募基金2016年四季报披露完毕，季报显示基金在行业上更加倾向制造业、金融业等传统配置领域，TMT等新兴板块投资吸引力进一步下降；个股方面一批绩优蓝筹股备受追捧，而部分昔日创业板""新贵""则人气急跌。
展望今年一季度，在不少基金经理眼中，市场将进入阶段性的""观察期""，基于盈利确定性和估值安全性原则之上的精选个股，成为""蓄势待春生""的主流策略。根据天相投顾截至上周六的数据统计，去年四季度末，全部基金股票平均可比样本仓位为64.49%，其中股票开放式基金和溷合开放式基金的股票仓位分别为88.34%和61.65%，与前一季度相比变动不大。季报显示，去年四季度公募""做足确定性""的整体操作思路显现。从行业角度看，基金投资的前三大行业依然是制造业、信息技术和金融业，但各行业间的配置结构和比例则是此消彼长。基金在制造业和金融业配置市值占净值比达到39.27%和4.13%，分别较前一季度末上升1.28和0.84个百分点，上升幅度在各行业中排名前两位。
信息传输、软件和信息技术服务业尽管依旧以4.46%的配置比例成为基金四季度末第二大投资领域，但基金配置市值占净值比已较前一季度末下降0.97个百分点，下滑最为明显。这也是近年来，基金在TMT这一曾经被机构众星捧月的板块内配置比例首次降到5%以下的记录（仅统计各季度末基金数据）。
重仓股方面，基金在去年四季度大举买入绩优蓝筹股，部分昔日创业板""新贵""的人气则明显回落。在单季被基金增持的前50大重仓股中，最具吸引力的是上汽集团
，重仓该股的基金数量从前一季度的47只勐增至148只，单季度净增加101只。重仓贵州茅台
的基金数量也从去年三季度末的115只增加到184只，单季度净增加69只，排名第二。 此外，在基金前50大重仓股中，重仓持有贵州茅台、五粮液
、上汽集团、格力电器 和美的集团 的基金数量均在130只以上，位列A股前列，低估值核心蓝筹的""避风港""效应由此可见一斑。
反观减持数据中，以创业板为代表的部分高估值个股去年四季度人气回落最为明显。统计显示，去年三季末重仓网宿科技
的基金数量多达107只，年末则锐减至34只，超过70只重仓基金选择减持或者卖出；其他被明显减持的个股还包括康得新 、大华股份 、欣旺达

","China Fund: Four Quarterly Bulletin Board shows large-scale replacement of core funds raised blue-chip funds, TMT decline in attractiveness - News Reuters Shanghai January 23 -
According to the Shanghai Securities News on Monday, as of today, the disclosure of the fourth quarterly report of 2016 raised funds is completed. The quarterly results show that the funds are more inclined towards the traditional allocation of manufacturing and financial industries in the industry. The attractiveness of investment in SINCERE NAVIGATION CORPORATION such as TMT further declines. A group of top blue chip stocks were highly sought after, while some former GEM ""upstarts"" plummeted popularity.
Looking forward to the first quarter of this year, in the eyes of many fund managers, the market will enter into a phased ""observation period"" and become the mainstream strategy of ""being ready for future generations"" based on the selected individual stocks based on the principles of profitability certainty and valuation security . According to the statistics of Ascertainment and Investment as of last Saturday, the average comparable sample position of all fund stocks was 64.49% at the end of the fourth quarter of last year, of which the stock positions of the stock open funds and the open-ended funds were 88.34% and 61.65% respectively, Compared with the previous quarter, little change. Quarterly Bulletin shows that in the fourth quarter of last year, the public offering ""certainty"" the overall operation of ideas appear. From an industry perspective, the top three sectors that fund investment are still manufacturing, information technology and financial sectors. However, the structure and proportion of the allocation among industries are exacerbated. The fund's market capitalization in manufacturing and financial services accounted for 39.27% ​​and 4.13% of the market value, up 1.28 and 0.84 percentage points from the end of the previous quarter respectively, ranking the top two in all industries.
Although the information transmission, software and information technology service industry still make up the second largest investment area by the end of the fourth quarter of the fund with a configured ratio of 4.46%, the market value of fund allocation has dropped by 0.97 percentage points from the end of the previous quarter, the most obvious decline. This is also the record for the first time in less than 5% of the fund's allocation to TMT, a sector that has been voted by the agencies in recent years (statistics for the end of each quarter only).
Awkwardness, the fund large-scale acquisition of blue-chip in the fourth quarter of last year, some of the former GEM ""upstart,"" the popularity dropped significantly. Among the top 50 Awkwardness holdings in a single quarter by the fund, SAIC Motor Corporation Limited is the most attractive one
, Shigekura stock the number of funds increased from 47 in the previous quarter to 148, a net increase of 101 in a single quarter. Heavy Position Guizhou Kweichow Moutai Co.,Ltd.
The number of funds also increased from 115 at the end of the third quarter of last year to 184, with a net increase of 69 in the single quarter, ranking second. In addition, the top 50 Awkwardness Fund, Shigekura holds Kweichow Moutai Co.,Ltd.,Wuliangye Yibin Co.,Ltd. in Guizhou.
, SAIC Motor Corporation Limited, Gree Electric Appliances, Inc. of Zhuhai and Midea Group Co.,Ltd. The number of funds of the Group are all above 130, ranking the top of the A shares. The ""safe haven"" effect of underevaluation core blue chips Can be seen.
On the contrary, holdings of data, the GEM as the representative of some of the high-valuation stocks in the fourth quarter of last year, the most obvious decline in popularity. Statistics show that Wangsu Science & Technology Co.,Ltd.
The number of funds as many as 107, dropped to 34 at the end of the year, more than 70 Shigekura fund options to reduce or sell; other significant holdings of stocks also include Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co.,Ltd.,ZHEJIANG DAHUA TECHNOLOGY CO.,LTD.,Sunwoda Electronic Co.,Ltd.
Wait. ** Low-risk products into the main source of fund companies profit ** To some extent, continued ""chaos"" in the basic market is an important factor in the ""conservative"" trend of the fund allocation as a whole. Under the upward trend of the stock market subsequently trended downwards, In the fourth quarter of last year, the fund's financial data also showed signs of weakness. Except for the Monetary Fund and QDII funds, the other types of funds as a whole lost money. Specifically, the monetary fund single quarter profit of 27.385 billion yuan, down 7.45% over the previous quarter; ODII Fund profit 327 million yuan, down 94.7% over the previous quarter. Tianxianggu 顾 顾 believes that the QDII fund's profit for three main reasons: First, the exchange rate changes, the second is the quantitative easing recovery in the stock market in Europe and the United States, the third is the rebound of resources, oil and gas commodities, which led to stock QDII and commodities QDII Fund net increase. On the other hand, the combined funds and bond funds reported losses of RMB25,856 million and RMB21,637 million respectively, representing the two largest losses in the quarter. Equity funds posted a loss of RMB4,362 million while guaranteed capital funds lost RMB2,588 million. Commodity The fund lost 1.16 billion yuan. From a corporate perspective, only the funds of 21 fund companies made a profit as a whole in the fourth quarter of last year. Among them, the highest-yielding fund was Tianhong Fund, with a profit of 4.742 billion yuan and a high proportion of low-risk products. The main source of profit was Yu Bao (profit 49.92 CHINA GENERAL PLASTICS CORPORATION ranked second with a current profit of RMB1.239 billion and China Merchants Fund and CCB Fund ranked third and fourth with a profit of RMB717 million and RMB580 million respectively.

I10ab75803b8911e7a7d2bc9b2f5174f5.1C,"《施凌观点－施宏毅》传统智慧的９个荒谬
《施凌观点》今日就跟大家分享９个荒谬的传统智慧，因为很多投资新手都十分依赖传统媒体，去学习所谓的传统投资智慧，但其实原来很多都是不准确，甚至甚至会令你亏损，所以今天特意分享，让大家走少一点冤枉路。１．蓝筹股稳健
蓝筹股指只代表当地指数，但不代表一定稳健，加上筛选蓝筹股公式上已有一定偏见，不能即时更新，令香港指数成分股，如例如旺旺（００１５１）、联想（００９９２）、思捷（００３３０）等，加入蓝筹股后就算下跌亦易入难出。２．重榜股低波幅
我们在港股中分别筛选出几只重榜股给大家参考，腾讯（００７００）就是其中一只市值最高的股票。众所周知是股价不断向上，而美股情况亦是同样。最主要视乎公司现金是否运用得宜，到时侯，股价自然可以不断创新高，相反用在不适当地方的话，股价终会下跌。３．细价股赚得多
别以为细价股升幅惊人，给你一个例子就会明白：普汇中金国际－新（００９９７）连续几天大幅度向上，当你以为可以入市时，发觉升势却是涉及财技成分，由大户２５股合为１股引起，所以除非知道「内幕消息」补捉完整升浪，否则还是可免则免。４．跌１０％止蚀
本来止蚀离场是正确方向，然而现实是很多股票跌１０％就会出现反弹，理文造纸（０２３１４）两次在高位跌１０％均有反弹，如你运用这个规则止蚀便会错失之后升幅，不断止蚀。下个问题是为何一定要用１０％作止蚀，不可用１５％还是２０％？其实这都是个人随心设定，没有数据支撑，事实上若你用技术分析进行部署会更有效。５．蟹货返家乡离场
当股价返回自己买入价后，很多人都会选择离场。皇家加勒比海邮轮（ＲＣＬ．ＵＳ）几次无法突破蟹货阻力区，当成功突破后若按买入价离场的话，你便会错失之后升幅。其实蟹货区基本上没有技术分析可言，当中长线公司有盈利时候，估值亦会慢慢变得吸引，另外亦要看环球资金流、成交量等进行买入策略。６．追落后
很多人会买走势较为落后的股票，以便从后赶上，然而去到跌市时，人们都不会去沽出强势领先股票，反而优先沽出落后股。有一个例子经常引用，就算刘翔不去跨栏跑，跟我们比赛跑步，我们输也是理所当然，因为关系到实力问题。用同一个理念去比较科网股，金山软件（０３８８８）及云游控股（００４８４）走势上呈现背驰，如选择后者，走势只会更为落后甚至下跌。原因就是金山软件盈利不断上升，云游控股却不断下跌，这个情况试问如何追落后。最终一定要看基本面。７．市盈率越高越贵
这个答桉相信大家都知道是一个谬误，腾讯市盈率几乎５０倍，但仍然可以继续破顶，最主要是市盈率没有量度增利增长，单纯利用过去数据去计算。８．三飞乌鸦
坊间经常提到「三飞乌鸦」或「三白武士」，代表连续３天阴烛下跌、或连续３天阳烛上升。其实两者都不可信。ＩＧＧ（００７９９）几乎连跌１０天后反弹，同样情况早前再连跌３天反弹再跌。问题就在于到底要跌多少天才有反弹，那就形成坊间的「四飞乌鸦」、「五飞乌鸦」等出现。９．五穷六绝七翻身
这是极荒谬但极多人相信，也让最多人下最大注。我们早前做个不同统计，证明五穷六绝七翻身是如何不准确。首先五穷六绝出现机会仅２４．４９％，再加上七翻身，成功发生只有５８．３３％。《施凌学会ＣＥＯ及「我要做股神」专页创办人

","""Shi Ling point of view - Shi Hongyi"" nine absurdities of traditional wisdom
Shi Ling's Opinion today shared with you nine ridiculous traditional wisdom because many new investors rely heavily on traditional media to learn the so-called wisdom of traditional investment. However, in fact, many of them are inaccurate and may even make you lose money , So today deliberately share, so that we go a little less costly mistakes. 1. Blue chip steady
The blue chip index only represents the local index, but does not mean that it must be solid. Besides, there is a certain bias on the formula for screening blue chip stocks and can not be updated immediately. Hong Kong index constituents such as Want (00151), LENOVO GROUP LIMITED (00992) (00330) and so on, even after joining the blue-chip stocks also fell into the difficulty. 2. Heavy heavy stocks low volatility
We have screened out several heavyweights in Hong Kong stocks for reference, Tencent Holdings Limited (00700) is one of the highest market value of the stock. As we all know, the stock price keeps going up while the US stocks are the same. Most depending on whether the company's cash is properly applied, the stock price will naturally be able to continue to record highs. Conversely, when used in inappropriate places, the stock price will eventually fall. 3. Penny stocks earn more
Do not think the Penny stocks rose amazingly, give you an example you will understand: PwC International - New (00997) a substantial upward for a few days, when you think you can enter the market, we find that the rise is related to financial and technical components, It is caused by a large share of 25 shares resulting in one share, so unless you know that ""insider information"" can capture the complete upswing, you may still be exempted. 4. Or 10% stop loss
However, the reality is that many stocks rebound after losing 10%. LEE & MAN PAPER MANUFACTURING LIMITED (02314) both rebounded 10% or 10% in the high. If you use this rule to stop the corrosion Will be missing after the increase, stop loss. The next question is why 10% must be used as a stop-loss, not 15% or 20%? In fact, these are personal settings, there is no data support, in fact, if you use technical analysis to deploy more effective. 5. Crab goods return home leave
When the stock returns its own purchase price, many people will choose to leave. The Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL.US) can not break the crab's cargo resistance area several times, and you will lose it after the successful break if you leave the bidding price. In fact, there is basically no technical analysis of the crab cargo area at all. In the case of long-term profit-making companies, the valuation will gradually become attractive. In addition, we will also look at the global capital flow and trading volume for buying strategies. 6. Catch up behind
Many people will buy the more backward stocks in order to catch up from behind. However, when they go to the falling market, they will not go out and sell the leading stocks but will give priority to selling outdated stocks. There is an example often quoted, even if Liu Xiang do not go hurdling race with us running, we lost is also taken for granted, because of the strength issues. Using the same philosophy to compare K-Web stocks, KINGSOFT CORPORATION LIMITED (03888) and Wan You Holdings (00484) showed signs of divergence. If the latter option is chosen, the trend will only be more backward or even declining. The reason is KINGSOFT CORPORATION LIMITED earnings continue to rise, Yunyou Holdings has been declining, how to catch up with the situation in this case. Ultimately we must look at the fundamentals. 7. The higher the price-earnings ratio more expensive
This Eucalyptus believes that we all know it is a fallacy. Tencent Holdings Limited has a P / E of almost 50x, but it can still continue to breach it. Mostly, P / E does not measure profit growth simply by using past data. 8. Three fly crow
Frequently referred to as ""San Fei Raven"" or ""Sam Ba Bai Samurai"", representing three consecutive days of falling candlesticks, or three consecutive days of rising candlesticks. In fact, both are not credible. IGG (00799) rebound after losing almost 10 days, the same situation earlier fell again three days rebounded further down. The problem lies in how many days it takes to rebound, then the formation of the ""Four Flying Crows"" and ""Five Flying Crows"" appear. 9. Five poor six must stand up
This is ridiculous but many people believe it, but also let the most people under the biggest note. Earlier, we made a different statistics to prove how inaccurate it is to turn over the poor and the poor. First of all, five poor six chance of emergence only 24.49%, plus seven turn over, the success of only 58.33%. ""Shi Ling CEO and"" I want to be a god of war ""page founder

I11483430e20411e6a694c7f12f30d3f8.1C,"各大环节 涌现新星
半导体多种产品中，以集成电路最普遍，其产业链大致可分为电路设计、芯片製造、封装及测试等3个主要环节。目前全个行业出现数种业务模式，一种是垂直分工模式，公司分别担当负责设计芯片架构的Fabless、主力生产晶圆的Foundry、以及专攻封装测试的厂商。另一种则是整合元件製造（Integrated
Device
Manufacturer，简称IDM）模式，一手包办设计、製造、封装测试及销售等所有环节。大型科技企业英特尔（Intel）和三星（Samsung），俱属于IDM厂商。内企积极布局Fabless
内地半导体业界虽缺乏英特尔和三星等独当一面的企业，惟在不同环节都正冒出头来。当中身处产业链最上游的IC设计，亦即Fabless模式，由于涉及的固定投资开支及营运成本，较其他环节便宜，在全球的收入跑赢IDM厂商之馀，亦吸引不少内企加入分一杯羹。根据Trendforce数据，藉自有品牌不断增加，2009年以来内地IC设计业产值在全球市佔率由7.1%，急升至2015年的15.8%。2014年全球50大Fabless公司中，内企佔了9间。
而云云内地Fabless企业中，以海思及展讯最突出。前身为华为集成电设计中心的海思，业务包括消费电子、通信等领域的芯片及解决方桉，服务全球100多个国家及地区的华为及其他牌子产品。和海思同样于2000年后成立的展讯，主打智能及功能型手机的芯片开发，已达全国3G及4G无綫通讯标准。展讯在2014年和锐迪科合併后，一同纳入紫光集团旗下的芯片业务部门。晶圆代工竞争白热化
相对Fabless快速增长，电子设备需求疲软、库存水平上涨及回报周期长等因素，令全球代工市场景气较弱。根据Gartner数据，全球2015年代工市场规模按年仅4%至488亿美元，中止连续三年双位数增长势头。与此同时，台积电、联电等国际巨头纷纷进军内地设厂，令内企晶圆代工市佔率近年不断下滑。目前国内较领先的代工商有中芯国际及华虹半导体（01347），而前者于2015年的营业额，仍不及龙头台积电的十分之一。
随着智能电视及OTT盒子在全球普及，晶圆产品已发展至高密度、晶体管速度更快的28纳米（nm）。相比目前业界主要生产的45nm，28nm具更大的成本优势，势成未来中外代工大厂的抢滩之地。继台积电及三星后，中芯亦于2015年开始生产28nm。随《集成电路纲要》出台，料吸引更多内企参与製造领域，拉近和国际大厂的距离。封测厂具国际竞争力
内企在产业链各环节中，以封测一环于全球最具竞争力，皆因封测属劳动密集型工序，所属资金及技术门槛都比设计及代工低，得以于内地较早发展。目地内地的封测企业，基本上已拥有生产不同制式的能力，符合各大客户的需要。
随着技术水平进步，配合积极併购同业，内地封测厂商的市佔率近年趋增，渐渐压过新加坡、日本等邻近地区。当中内地第一大封测厂长电科技（沪：600584）得产业基金之协助下，成功收购新加坡同业星科金朋，跻身全球三大封测厂行列。其他企业如华天科技（深：002185）及通富微电等，过去两年亦有参与境外收购，提高竞争力。随着电子消费品趋向小型及易携，内地企业积极开发技术要求更高的晶圆级封装（WLP）、倒装芯片及2.5D/3D市场，开拓一条新蓝海。

","Emerging from all major aspects of the star
A variety of semiconductor products to the most common integrated circuits, the industrial chain can be divided into circuit design, chip manufacturing, packaging and testing of the three major links. Currently there are several business models in the industry, one is the vertical division of labor model, the company responsible for the design of the chip architecture Fabless, Wafer Foundries, and specializing in package testing vendors. The other is integrated components manufacturing (Integrated
Device
Manufacturer, referred to as IDM) model, one-handedly arranged design, manufacture, packaging and testing and sales of all aspects. Large technology companies Intel and Samsung, all IDM vendors. Domestic enterprises active layout Fabless
Although the semiconductor industry in the Mainland lacks the independent enterprises such as Intel and Samsung, it is emerging at different stages. Among them, the IC design, the Fabless model, which is the most upstream IC in the industry chain, is cheaper than other parts because of the fixed investment and operating costs involved. As a result, its global revenue outperforms the IDM vendors and attracts many domestic enterprises A cup of soup According to Trendforce data, the market share of the IC design industry in the Mainland has risen sharply from 7.1% in the world to 15.8% in 2015 due to the growing number of its own brands. Among the 50 largest Fabless companies in the world in 2014, domestic enterprises accounted for 9.
The Fabless enterprises in China, the most prominent HiSilicon and Spreadtrum. Hisilicon, formerly known as Huawei's Integrated Design Center, operates in chips and solutions in the fields of consumer electronics and communications and serves Huawei and other brands in more than 100 countries and regions. And Hayes also set up in 2000 after the Spreadtrum, the flagship smart and feature-based mobile phone chip development, has reached the national 3G and 4G wireless communications standards. Spreadtrum merged with Ruidike in 2014, together with the chip business unit of Ziguang Group. Foundry competition white-hot
Relative to Fabless's rapid growth, weak demand for electronic equipment, rising inventory levels and long payback period, the global foundry market is weak. According to Gartner data, the global OEM market size was only 4% yoy to US $ 48.8bn last year, halting double-digit growth for three consecutive years. At the same time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,Ltd. electricity, UNITED MICROELECTRONICS CORP. And other international giants have set foot in the Mainland to set up factories, so that domestic enterprises foundry market share declining in recent years. At present, there are SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION and HUA HONG SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (01347), while the former's turnover in 2015 is still less than one-tenth of that of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,Ltd.
With the popularity of smart TVs and OTT boxes around the world, wafer products have evolved to high-density, transistor-speed 28 nanometers (nm). Compared to the current industry's main production of 45nm, 28nm with greater cost advantage, potential into the future Chinese and foreign OEMs beachhead. Following Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,Ltd. and Samsung, SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION also started production of 28nm in 2015. With the ""Integrated Circuit Outline"" promulgated, expected to attract more domestic enterprises involved in manufacturing, narrowing the distance with the international manufacturers. IC packaging and testing with international competitiveness
In the various links of the industrial chain, the most competitive part of the IC packaging and testing industry in the world is that IC packaging and testing is a labor-intensive process. All the funds and technology thresholds are lower than the design and foundry, so that it can be developed earlier in the Mainland . Purpose of the Mainland's IC packaging and testing enterprises, basically have the ability to produce different standards, in line with the needs of major customers.
With the improvement of technology and the active acquisition of the same industry, the market share of IC packaging and testing companies in the Mainland has been on the rise in recent years and gradually pushed over the neighboring regions such as Singapore and Japan. Among them, the first large-scale test and measurement plant in the Mainland, with the help of Industrial Fund (600 6004), successfully acquired Singapore-based Starbucks and ranks among the top three IC packaging and testing plants in the world. Other companies such as Tianshui Huatian Technology Co.,Ltd. (深: 002185) and Fortune Microelectronics have also participated in overseas acquisitions in the past two years to enhance their competitiveness. As consumer electronics tend to be smaller and more portable, mainland companies are aggressively developing WLP, flip chip and 2.5D / 3D markets to create a new blue ocean.",各大环节 涌现新星,Not Reuters,08:07AM 07 Feb 2016,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I11483430e20411e6a694c7f12f30d3f8.1C.html
I11c707403d0011e793bd897b8c5dec4b.1C,"辨别真假新闻教育最有效去年在美国总统大选期间，在社交网络上谣言满天飞，虚假新闻层出不穷，渗透全美每一角落。例如「教宗赞助特朗普」、「希拉莉向伊斯兰国（ISIS）贩卖军火」等假新闻在「脸书」上的分享及点评率远比传统纸媒为高。大选过后，主流社交媒体的可靠性遭全球质疑。闢谣顿时成为社交网络各持份者的重要工作，首当其冲的当然是被特朗普政府指控包括「脸书」、「谷歌」在内的网络巨企。就此「脸书」于去年十二月起利用第三者专家平台如「联合通信社」（Associate
Press，AP），对用户转载的新闻进行真确性评分。另外，「谷歌」亦随即利用同样方法处理新闻搜寻结果。两者的目标一致，旨在给予接收新闻的下游用户警示，但新闻真假的判断最终还是留待读者自行定夺。实际上这做法并非任何新概念，「维基百科」在编辑管理的过程中，对于没有提供足够理据的文章亦会发出警示。然而，以「维基百科」为例，这做法的实际成效不大，不少用户对警示往往视而不见。除引入评分外，「谷歌」再进一步主动阻截含有虚假新闻的网页，出现在其旗下AdSense广告平台上，此举通过减少广告收益来惩罚不诚实的公司，以收阻吓之效。「脸书」也不遑多让，它们设法拦截载有误导或欺骗性内容的广告，当中也包括虚假新闻，目的是为了杜绝谣言在应用软件（Apps）或网站上散播。有美国IT专家认为上述的做法成效有限。不同人对同一事件会有不同的看法，正如英歇后语云：「what
one man's meat is another man's
poison」（一个人的肉是另一人的毒）。例如一个宗教坚持的真理，对于另一宗教而言可能是谬论，由此可见新闻真伪的判断难以维持其公正性。辨别端伪事半功倍近年，世界各国不遗馀力加强网络闢谣力度。例如，德国通过法例，要求社交媒体在二十四小时之内删除虚假讯息，不然的话，违例者最高的罚款可高达五千万欧罗（即四点二亿港元）。又例如，中国互联网信息办公室于一六年七月公布《关于进一步加强管理制止虚假新闻的通知》，要求各网站确保新闻报道的真实性、全面性及客观性，并明确提出多项禁令，包括：（一）严禁社交网站虚假标注新闻来源；（二）严禁歪曲事实，编造新闻。中央政府更下令各级网信办切实履行网络内容管理的职责，加强监督检查，严惩违法之徒。可是网民普遍抗拒政府进行网络监控的行为，批评此举严重打压网络言论自由，窒碍网络社会及经济发展。换个角度，「脸书」近期以教育形式推行另一闢谣措施。他们在全球十四个国家推出「辨别假新闻」的指引。用户在连接「脸书」新闻频道（newsfeed）时，指引将自动开启，提醒用户如何能有效判断网上新闻的端伪。重点的指引包括再三确认网址、多参阅其他同类新闻并作比较、检查新闻中照片的可信性。然而，IT专家认为这做法对用户毫无约束力，因而质疑其实际效用。笔者却有不同的看法，上述以社交媒体阻截及政府监管主导的方桉只能治标却不能治本，提高网民对主动求真的文化及辨别端伪的能力才可事半功倍。要达到这目标，教育尤其重要，而且必须从小开始。不过现时的IT教育主要聚焦在技术课程，而网络行为尤其是与道德相关的教育甚为缺乏。所谓「十年树木，百年树人」，网络教育是没有捷径的，纵然「脸书」的教育方桉未算完善，但长远而言，教育才是最有效的解决方法。最后，候任特首林郑月娥把教育视为她上任后的三项首要任务之一。笔者希望网络行为及道德教育，将会是新政府的教育发展蓝图中的重要一环。黄锦辉教授香港中文大学工程学院副院长（外务）

","Discrimination Between True and False News Education is Most Effective Last year in the U.S. presidential election, rumors flooded social networks and infamous fake news infiltrated every corner of the country. Fake news such as ""Pope-sponsored Trump"" and ""Hillary Clinton's arms sales to the ISIS"" were far more popular on Facebook than on traditional paper media. After the election, the reliability of the mainstream social media was questioned globally. Rumor has suddenly become an important part of the social network stakeholders, the first and foremost to be accused by the Trump administration, including ""Facebook"", ""Google"", including the Internet giant. In response, Facebook launched a third-party expert platform such as Associate
Press, AP) to rate the authenticity of the news reproduced by users. In addition, ""Google"" will then use the same method of processing news search results. Both aim at the same time, aiming to give warnings to downstream users who receive the news, but the judgment of the truth of the news is ultimately left to the reader's discretion. In fact, this is not a new concept. ""Wikipedia"" also warns about the lack of good arguments in the process of editorial management. However, taking ""Wikipedia"" as an example, the practical effect of this approach is modest. Many users often turn a blind eye to the warnings. In addition to the introduction of ratings, Google further took the initiative to block pages containing fake news appearing on its AdSense advertising platform, punishing dishonest companies for deterrence by reducing advertising revenue. Much less so than ""Facebook,"" they seek to block ads that contain misleading or deceptive content, including fake news, in an attempt to stop the spread of rumors on the Apps or websites. Some experts from the U.S. I.T LIMITED believe that the above-mentioned approach has had limited success. Different people will have different views on the same incident, just as the English language after the rest said: ""what
one man's meat is another man's
poison ""(one's flesh is another's poison). For example, the truth that a religion adheres to may be a fallacy for another religion. This shows that it is difficult to maintain the fairness of the authenticity of the news. In recent years, all countries in the world have spared no effort in strengthening Internet rumor. For example, Germany passed laws that require social media to remove false messages within 24 hours, otherwise up to fines of up to 50 million euros (or 420 million Hong Kong dollars). As another example, the Internet Information Office of China released the Notice on Further Strengthening Management and Suppression of False News in July 2006, requiring websites to ensure the truthfulness, comprehensiveness and objectivity of news coverage and to explicitly put forward a number of injunctions, including (1) Social media websites are strictly forbidden to annotate news sources; (2) It is forbidden to distort facts and fabricate news. The Central Government also ordered all levels of Internet Sub-offices to effectively perform their duties of network content management, stepped up supervision and inspection, and severely punished those who violated the law. However, Internet users generally resist the government's conduct of network monitoring and criticism of the move that has severely suppressed the freedom of speech on the Internet and hindered the social and economic development of the Internet. In other words, Facebook recently implemented another rumor in the form of education. In 14 countries around the world, they launched the ""Guide to Identifying False News."" When users connect to ""newsfeed,"" the guidelines will be automatically activated to remind users how to judge the validity of online news effectively. Key guidelines include re-checking web sites, reviewing and comparing other similar news stories to check the credibility of the photos in the news. However, I.T LIMITED experts consider the practice to be non-binding on users and therefore question its actual utility. The author has different viewpoints. The above-mentioned social media stop-and-governed government regulation can only cure the problem but can not cure it. It is only possible to increase Internet users' ability to take the initiative to seek truth and distinguish the false ends. To achieve this goal, education is especially important and must start early. However, current I.T LIMITED education is mainly focused on technical courses, and online education is especially lacking in ethics-related education. The so-called ""10-year-old trees and 100-year-old tree people"" have no short-cut in online education. Education is the most effective solution in the long run, even if the educational program on Facebook is not complete. Finally, the Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam, regarded education as one of the three top priorities after her appointment. The author hopes that network behavior and moral education will be an important part of the new government's blueprint for education development.

周乾宪“‘一带一路’使各国互联互通，实现共赢，是一个具有世界意义、具有人类情怀的大创新。”泰国正大集团资深董事长谢国民接受中新社记者专访时表示，正大集团愿积极响应“一带一路”倡议。“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛近日在京举办，谢国民作为侨界代表受邀出席。他介绍，正大集团将同中国企业在技术、融资、建设方面进行合作，投资泰国高铁项目，使其成为“一带一路”建设的组成部分。“从泰国首都曼谷到罗勇府，途经旅游胜地芭提雅。泰国70%的经济集中在这200多公里铁路沿线。”谢国民说，除了建设高铁，还建议泰国政府将铁路沿岸打造成4.0高科技工业园区，吸引全世界的技术和人才。“各国要考虑如何把‘一带一路’倡议的好处变成现实。”谢国民认为，建设这些项目对国家有什么贡献，对企业有什么好处，能给老百姓带来哪些实惠，这些都要讲得清清楚楚，才能让大家理解中国所提的共商、共建、共享。1921年，旅泰华侨谢易初、谢少飞在泰国创办正大集团，以农牧食品、商业零售、电讯为核心事业，推进多元化经营。谢易初为四个儿子取名谢正民、谢大民、谢中民、谢国民，姓名中间字连起来是“正大中国”。1969年，谢国民继承了其父的事业。1979年，借中国改革开放之机，正大集团在深圳建立正大康地有限公司，成为中国第一家外商独资企业。之后，正大集团又相继在珠海、汕头领取了“001号”在华外商投资企业营业执照。谢国民告诉中新社记者，“三十多年前到中国投资时，中国刚改革开放，外汇缺少、人才缺乏、基础设施较为落后。中国经济快速发展到今天，十分了不起，公路、铁路、机场、水运等基础设施建设完善，外汇储备充足，创新创业环境日臻成熟。”上世纪90年代，正大集团与中央电视台合办的《正大综艺》节目在全国引起广泛关注，主题曲《爱的奉献》深入人心，至今不少中国人都能吟唱。也确如歌词“爱是人类最美好的语言，爱是正大无私的奉献”所唱，正大集团常年热衷于公益事业。在“非典”时期和汶川大地震中积极捐款，还无偿捐助教育事业。多年来，正大集团为中国社会公益事业累计捐款金额超5亿元人民币。2015年9月，中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利70周年纪念活动在北京天安门广场举行。谢国民应邀登上天安门城楼观礼。他说，“我做梦都没想过能登上天安门城楼观看阅兵。”从积极投身中国的改革开放事业到如今积极参与“一带一路”建设，正大集团不断加大在中国的投资，成为在华投资规模最大、投资项目最多、投资金额最大的外商投资企业之一。谢国民说，“我对中国未来的经济发展充满了信心。”（完）

 Sunny Optical Technology (Group) Company Limited Optical Technology (02382): The Group is principally engaged in the design, research and development, manufacture and sale of optical and related products and scientific instruments. Multiple handset brands in the global market saw their smartphone shipments soar last year. Sunny Optical Technology (Group) Company Limited Optical Co.,Ltd. This year, handset lens loans will reach 478 million, an increase of 26% at the same time, benefiting from the increased use of dual-lens phones in China and leading edge brands in China driving the sales of high-end mobile phone lenses. Overseas customers demand for stable growth of the lens. Mobile phone lens module recorded a 17% increase in shipments. In addition, the international brand Apple's share price hit a new peak. With the increase in sales of mobile phone related industries, it is expected to support more orders of the Group in the future. The stock price and P / E ratio are now high. Waiting for the stock price to fall when buying. The proposed purchase price of 43.35 yuan, the target price of 48.00 yuan, the stop-loss price of 40.00 yuan. (Price proposed on Monday this week: $ 44.95)
China Aisino Corporation Network (00696): The Group is the leading provider of information technology solutions to China's aviation and tourism industry. The Group's core businesses include aviation information technology services, distribution information technology services, clearing and settlement services. China Aisino Corporation is the leader in the industry. Although the aviation industry is greatly affected by the economy, it is evident from the past performance of China's Aisino Corporation that the company is relatively stable. With China's sustained economic development, there is still room for growth in domestic aviation. This enterprise will certainly benefit from it. Although development is a steady growth, we believe there is no problem with the steady development. However, the rate of return on investment is similar. However, it is not difficult to obtain a higher return than the rest of the industry. With the support of government, the direction of development is even better. Therefore, the overall preference given to the rating, there is a certain degree of quality.
As for the current price, the current price-earnings ratio at the level of 24, with its growth and ROE, is considered a reasonable level. If the stock price is lower at a lower level, I believe it will be better. Therefore, the investment may wait for a slight fall before the stock can begin to absorb and can be used for long-term investment.

鲁毅）由中车株洲电力机车研究所有限公司（以下简称“中车株洲所”）研制的全球首列虚拟轨道列车（以下简称“智轨”）2日在湖南株洲首次亮相。这一名为“智能轨道快运系统”的全新交通产品既能保持像轨道列车大载客量优势，又不需要建造专有钢轨，将为解决现代城市交通运输难题提供新的选择。据中车株洲所智轨列车项目组组长冯江华介绍，智轨列车看似无轨，实则有“轨”，只不过采用了中车株洲所自主研发、全球首创的“虚拟轨道跟随控制”技术。该技术通过车载各类传感器识别路面虚拟轨道线路，将运行信息传送至列车“大脑”（中央控制单元），根据“大脑”的指令，在保证列车实现牵引、制动、转向等正常动作的同时，能够精准控制列车行驶在既定“虚拟轨迹”上，实现智能运行。记者现场看到，智轨列车长达30多米，堪称马路上的“巨无霸”。冯江华表示，超长车身并不妨碍列车的灵活性。该列车采用了多轴转向系统等设计方式，使整台列车转弯半径与普通公交车相当，且比普通公交车辆的通道宽度更小，可以在大多数城市道路上通行。同时，智轨列车采用类似高铁的双车头设计，省却了掉头的麻烦。与现代有轨电车相比，智轨列车设计最高时速同样为每小时70公里，但因为不依赖钢轨行驶，一条运行线的建设周期仅需一年，能快速投入使用。另外，智轨列车还具有轻轨、地铁等轨道列车的零排放、无污染的特性，并支持多种供电方式。当天，株洲市官方宣布，为智轨列车量身定做的中国首条智能轨道快运系统示范线路将进入实质规划阶段。根据规划目标，该条示范线有望在2018年投入商业运营。此外，智轨列车采用高铁柔性编组的模式，能根据客流变化调节运力，比如采用标准的3节编组时，列车可载客超过300人，5节编组时可载客超过500人，能有效解决普通公交车载客量小的缺陷，大大提高运力。与现代有轨电车相比，智轨还拥有绝对成本优势。冯江华为记者算了一笔账：目前，中国地铁造价约为4至7亿元（人民币，下同）每公里，现代有轨电车线路造价约为1.5至2亿元每公里，而“智轨”在与现代有轨电车运力相同的情况下，只需简单的道路改造就能投入使用，整体线路的投资约为现代有轨电车的五分之一。冯江华认为，以智轨列车为核心运载工具的智能轨道快运系统具有建设周期短、基础设施投资小、城市适应性高、综合运力强等优势特点，是兼顾运能与投资的中运量轨道交通系统解决方桉。（完）

","[Science, Culture and Education] The world's first virtual train Zhuzhou rail transit debut China Zhuzhou, Hunan, June 2 (Reporter
Lu Yi) The world's first virtual track train developed by Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Research Institute Co.,Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""CSR Zhuzhou Office"") debuted on the 2nd in Zhuzhou, Hunan on the 2nd. The VISUAL PHOTONICS EPITAXY CO.,LTD.,A smart track express system, not only offers the advantage of a large passenger rail capacity but also eliminates the need to build proprietary rails that will solve the transportation challenges of modern cities New choice. According to Feng Jianghua, head of the project team of Zhoushi in Chongqing Zhuzhou Railway, the seemingly no-track train actually has a ""track"", but only adopts the ""virtual track-following control"" technology pioneered by Zhuzhou Auto in China . The technology through the various types of sensors on the vehicle to identify the virtual track line pavement, the operation information is transmitted to the train ""brain"" (central control unit), according to the ""brain"" command, to ensure the trains traction, braking, steering and other normal actions , Can precisely control the train driving in the established ""virtual trajectory"" to achieve intelligent operation. Reporters on the scene saw the train train up to more than 30 meters, called the road ""giant."" Feng Jianghua said that the long body does not prevent the train flexibility. The train uses a multi-axis steering system and other design methods, so that the entire train turning radius and ordinary buses, and smaller than the average bus width of the corridor, you can in most cities on the road access. At the same time, the intelligent rail train adopts the dual-head design similar to Taiwan High Speed ​​Rail Corporation, eliminating the inconvenience of making a U-turn. Compared with the modern tram, the highest speed of the ICR is 70 km / h. However, since it does not rely on rails, the construction period of a running line can only be one year and it can be put into operation quickly. In addition, the train also has a light rail, subway and other rail trains zero emissions, pollution-free features, and supports a variety of power supply. On the same day, Zhuzhou City officially announced that the first intelligent track express system demonstration circuit tailored for the I-TRAIN train will enter the substantive planning stage. According to the planning goal, this model line is expected to be put into commercial operation in 2018. In addition, the intelligent rail train adopts the flexible grouping mode of Taiwan High Speed ​​Rail Corporation, which can adjust the capacity according to the change of passenger flow. For example, when the standard 3-section grouping is adopted, the train can carry more than 300 passengers and 5 groups can carry more than 500 passengers , Can effectively solve the shortcomings of ordinary buses carrying capacity, greatly improving capacity. Compared with modern trams, TRT also has the absolute cost advantage. Feng Jianghua took a reporter's account. At present, the cost of a metro in China is about 400 to 700 million yuan (RMB), and the cost of a modern tram line is about 1.5 to 200 million yuan per kilometer. Rail ""With the same capacity as a modern tram, it can be put into operation with a simple road improvement, with the total investment being about a fifth of that of a modern tram. Feng Jianghua believes that an intelligent orbit express system that uses an intellectual rail vehicle as the core delivery vehicle has the advantages of short construction period, small investment in infrastructure, high adaptability in urban areas and comprehensive transportation capacity.

外汇策略师和基金经理表示，由于加拿大严重倚赖对美国的出口，因此美国提议的边境税调整威胁可能损及加元，然而近期加元却走强，使此预期落空。分析师表示，如果特朗普政府实施边境税，作为其致力于打击贸易伙伴国不公平竞争的一部分，那么加元将会是最大的输家之一。他们预期此举将降低加拿大出口的竞争力，并让其石油等主要大宗商品的价格因美元走强而承受压力。加拿大对美出口占其总出口的75%。受此影响，加元可能会大幅下挫。自2014年夏季油价见顶以来，加元兑美元已贬值近20%。""我认为，市场尚未充分反映出可能出现的边境税调整的影响，""宏利资产管理资深主管和投资组合经理Hosen

","""Focus"" Canadian dollar recently strengthened, but fear has not yet fully reflect the threat of U.S. border tax adjustment Reuters Toronto, February 17 -
Foreign exchange strategists and fund managers said that as the country relies heavily on its exports to the United States, the threat of adjustment of the border tax proposed by the United States may harm the Canadian dollar. However, the recent strength of the Canadian dollar has depreciated the forecast. Analysts say the Canadian dollar will be one of the biggest losers if the Trump administration enforces border taxes as part of its commitment to fighting unfair competition from trading partners. They expect the move will reduce the competitiveness of Canada's exports and put the prices of its major commodities such as oil under pressure as the dollar strengthens. Canada exports to the United States accounted for 75% of its total exports. Affected by this, the Canadian dollar may fall sharply. Since the peak in oil prices in summer 2014, the Canadian dollar has depreciated nearly 20% against the dollar. ""I think the market has not fully reflected the possible impact of border tax adjustments,"" said Hosny Mann, senior director and portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management
Marjaee said. The Canadian dollar has gained 1.5% against the dollar since Trump won the November 8 election, making it the best performing currency in the Group 10 (G10) currency. Bank of America Merrill Lynch foreign exchange analyst Ian
Gordon said that if the border tax is levied, the Canadian dollar will have to fall 10% to offset its negative impact on Canada's export competitiveness. ""From the Washington conversation, the president and many of his consultants talk about the (border tax) idea more than a month ago,"" Gordon said. Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that the rules on border tax adjustments were ""too complicated."" He vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). [nL4S1F71ZN] The market has been ""only bullish on Trump's election ... ignored the more negative aspects of trade,"" said Jimmy Desjardins, senior economist at Desjardins
Jean said. Trump, on Monday, joined Justin, the Canadian prime minister
Trudeau) said at a joint press conference that he only wanted to fine-tune the trade agreement with Canada. This boosted the Canadian dollar. [nL4S1FY5DL] But levying a border tax will ""plunge Canada"" and Canada's C.D.
Howe
The Institute pointed out in a research note on Tuesday. The agency estimates that Canada's real gross domestic product (GDP) will likely be reduced by nearly 1%. The border tax is one of the major changes proposed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. After the border tax is implemented, U.S. businesses will not be able to reduce their tax burden by cutting import costs. The proposed reform by the U.S. House of Representatives also includes lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. ""Border taxes make up for the downgrades, and Republicans will not want the deficit to skyrocket,"" Jean of Desjardins said. The move still faces objections from U.S.-based companies that rely on imports, and not all investors think the market miscalculated the risk of the Canadian dollar. ""We're not crazy crazy in the Canadian dollar,"" Pacific, a Canadian portfolio manager
Head of Investment Management Ed
Devlin said, ""If the border tax goes into effect, then we will be there."" In addition to the border tax, the threat to the Canadian dollar includes the Federal Reserve's (FED) rate hike faster than the market expected, which will enable US dollar exchange rate further improved. Fed policymakers now expect a three-rate hike this year. On the contrary, analysts said the Canadian economy has seen its economic growth momentum increase after the impact of the drop in oil prices in 2014-2016. The country's central bank is expected to maintain interest rates unchanged. And if the border tax is imposed by the United States, the Bank of Canada may also cut interest rates.

觅长期主题投资由于目前许多资产的估值已经过高，投资者正转向受益于人口结构、社会经济趋势和科学进展等主题投资。瑞信以下将总结出5个超级趋势作为长期主题投资，并预料将在未来多年提供吸引的投资机会。长期主题投资追求从多年趋势的可预测性和可持续性中获利。未来5个超级趋势分别是：（1）多极世界、（2）基础设施、（3）科技服务人类、（4）银髪经济，以及（5）千禧一代的价值观。我们预料这些长期主题将在未来多年居支配地位。（1）多极世界自2008年金融海啸以来，多个国家及地区都出现贫富悬殊加剧的情况，已发展国家尤甚。财政紧缩加上宽鬆货币政策，对中产阶层特别不利。超级全球化和破坏性的科技发展，已使经济衰退后的劳动力市场愈趋艰困。这些因素使许多中产家庭的生活在金融海啸后变得更差【图1】。面对看似无法控制的移民数量和恐怖主义崛起等重要问题，中产阶层对显然无能的所谓「政治精英」愈来愈失望，部分已发展国家的人民开始动员推动政治变革，其结果已愈来愈明显。部分已发展国家在接下来的4至7年内，将实施有利西方中产阶层选民的经济政策措施。由于中产阶层高度重视安全和保障，新政府可能会加大投资于国家安全和国防，并激励私人消费。投资者可以预料，部分行业和公司将受益于这类政策，令销售、营收和市场估值显着上升。基建科技医疗看高一线（2）基础设施在2016年8月，我们确定了基础设施是一个吸引的长期投资主题，因为非传统货币政策正逐渐失效，而且有愈来愈多共识认为，摆脱全球萧条陷阱是需要结合扩张性的货币政策和财政政策。说到底，基础设施支出通常会增加就业职位，并产生强劲的经济乘数，提高社会生产力。由于全球许多地方的实质利率仍为负数，所以基础设施项目的融资环境十分理想。视乎投资者的风险偏好和对流动性不足的容忍度，投资者可选择不同方式投资于基础设施。对私人投资者来说，最直接的途径是聚焦那些将受益于大兴土木的基建行业和公司，再根据基本面进行筛选。（3）科技服务人类数码化是大势所趋，藉人工智能（AI）创造的收入将与日俱增【图2】，而大数据、虚拟实境（VR）、扩增实境（AR）、物联网和机械人等科技，也将提供巨大的投资机会。互联网平台公司、网络广告代理商，以及活用物联网和云计算而改变行业生态的公司，都可获得长期收益。数码化也有负面的一面，资讯盗窃是一种严重的风险，因此我们认为网络安全将继续成为最具增长潜力的领域之一。此外，几何级增长的数据洪流亦可能导致储存成本上升，为相关行业带来机遇。（4）银髮经济提到人口老化，人们通常都会想到欧洲和日本，因为两地的生育率几十年来一直下降。然而，人们不是那麽容易察觉到，未来30年全球潮汐式人口结构变化下，不少国家都将面临严重人口老化的考验【图3】。全球60岁以上人口，估计将从2015年的9亿人上升至2050年的21亿人，预计仅仅3年后的2020年，60岁以上人口的消费力已将达到15万亿美元。随着全球人口急剧老化，青年与老年人的比率（抚养比率）下跌，将带来巨大的社会挑战，但同时也提供投资机会。我们认为，投资者可按照老年人的生活方式和消费需要来作好部署，例如医疗保健业、老年人住屋及融资等。（5）千禧一代的价值观千禧一代是历史上人口数量最大的一代【图4】。他们具有庞大影响力，并且快将成为成熟投资者。瑞信已准备好实现千禧一代的投资目标，面对上述投资主题，他们的价值观将是举足轻重。作者为瑞信亚太区投资策略师

Finding Long-Term Themed Investment With the current valuation of many assets already too high, investors are turning to thematic investments that benefit from demographic structure, socio-economic trends and scientific advances. Credit Suisse The following five super trends will be summarized as a long-term theme of investment and is expected to provide attractive investment opportunities for many years to come. Long-Term Thematic Investment seeks to profit from the predictability and sustainability of multi-year trends. The next five megatrends are: (1) a multi-polar world, (2) infrastructure, (3) human services for science and technology, (4) a silver economy, and (5) millennial values. We expect these long-term themes will dominate for many years to come. (1) Multipolar World Since the financial tsunami in 2008, the disparity between the rich and the poor has been exacerbated in many countries and regions, particularly in the developed countries. Fiscal tightening and loose monetary policy are particularly detrimental to the middle class. The super-globalization and devastating scientific and technological developments have made the labor market after the economic recession increasingly difficult. These factors made many middle-class families worse off after the financial tsunami (Figure 1). Faced with such major issues as seemingly uncontrollable immigration and the rise of terrorism, the middle class is increasingly disappointed by the apparently ineffective so-called ""political Elitegroup Computer Systems Co.,Ltd."" and some people in developed countries are starting to mobilize their efforts to promote politics Change, the result has become more apparent. In the next four to seven years, some developed countries will implement economic and policy measures that will benefit the middle-class voters. As the middle class pays great attention to safety and security, the new government may increase its investment in national security and national defense and incentivize private consumption. Investors can expect some industries and companies to benefit from such policies, resulting in significant sales, revenue and market valuations. Infrastructure Technology Healthcare Looking at the G-Line (2) Infrastructure In August 2016, we identified infrastructure as a long-term investment attraction, as non-traditional monetary policies are gradually failing and there is growing consensus that getting out of the world Depression trap is the need to combine expansionary monetary policy and fiscal policy. At the end of the day, spending on infrastructure usually increases employment and generates a strong economic multiplier, raising social productivity. As real interest rates in many parts of the world are still negative, the financing environment for infrastructure projects is ideal. Depending on the investor's risk appetite and tolerance for illiquidity, investors have different options for investing in infrastructure. For private investors, the most direct way is to focus on those infrastructure industries and companies that will benefit from the booming economy and then screen them according to the fundamentals. (3) Technological Services Digital humanization is the trend of the times. The revenue generated by artificial intelligence (AI) will increase day by day. However, big data, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), Internet of Things and machinery People and other technologies, but also will provide tremendous investment opportunities. Internet platform companies, online advertising agencies, and companies that use the Internet of Things and cloud computing to change the ecosystem of their industries are reaping long-term benefits. Digitization also has the downside. Information theft is a serious risk, so we think cybersecurity will continue to be one of the areas with the most potential for growth. In addition, the flood of data at geometric levels may also lead to increased storage costs and opportunities for related industries. (4) Silver economy The economy refers to the aging population. People usually think of Europe and Japan because their fertility rates have been declining for decades. However, people are not so easily aware that under the global tidal demographic structure in the next 30 years, many countries will face the test of serious population aging [Figure 3]. The global population over the age of 60 is estimated to rise from 900 million in 2015 to 2.1 billion by 2050. It is estimated that spending on the population over the age of 60 will reach 15 trillion U.S. dollars in 2020 in just three years. As the world's population ages sharply, the declining ratio of youth to the elderly (dependency ratio) will pose a huge social challenge but at the same time provide investment opportunities. We believe that investors can make the deployment according to the lifestyle and consumption needs of the elderly, such as health care, housing for the elderly and financing. (5) Millennial values ​​Millennials are the largest generation in history (Figure 4). They have great influence and are soon to be mature investors. Credit Suisse is ready to meet Millennial investment goals. Their values ​​will be decisive in the face of these investment themes.

I147dfc2047d011e7b3f4d29b035ab63e.1C,"年金率不等于内部回报率早前按揭证券公司宣布将推出「终身年金计划」，坊间又称「公共年金计划」，目前正进行落实计划的工作，期望能于明年中推出。近来笔者收到不少客户对计划的查询，身边亦有不少朋友对计划一知半解；因此，笔者尝试再简单说明，并趁机表达一些个人对此计划的意见。毕竟到此刻为止，计划尚未落实，所有细节仍待正式公布时才能知道。计划的对象是65岁以上人士，他们投入一笔过的保费后，便可收到年金直至百年归老，计划接受的保费金额暂定5万至100万元。根据按揭证券公司初步估算，假设内部回报率为3%至4%，男性于65岁投保，每10万元的保费预料每月可收取500至580元的固定年金，即每年年金6000至6960元，年金率约6%至7%；女性于65岁投保，则每10万元保费每月可收取450至530元的年金，即每年年金为5400至6360元，年金率约为5.4%至6.4%。男女收到的年金不同，是因为他们的预期寿命不同，女性预期寿命较男性长。派息兼派本有稳定收入根据以上的数字，有人可能会误以为终身年金计划每年回报率有6%至7%，他们甚至把它与一些派息4%至5%的房地产基金（REIT）比较，认为终身年金计划的回报更吸引。其实，他们溷淆了年金率和内部回报率的关係。在金融财务上，我们习惯叫内部回报率（Internal
Rate of
Return或IRR），它就是一般所说的回报率。可以想象终身年金计划是一个派息兼派本的工具，当投保人收到年金时，本金亦会一直减少。直至投保人百年归老时，年金会派发完，没有本金可以届时取回；因此，每年收取6%至7%的是年金的派发率，不等于实际回报率，目前假设的回报率只有3%至4%。其实，年金的作用是为退休人士提供一个稳定的收入，以免他们在退休后仍然要为他们的投资担惊受怕。大家都知道不论是物业或股票都有风险，一旦遇上股灾或楼市的下行周期，市场的波动往往会对退休人士构成一定程度的压力。相反，年金就能提供简单的现金收入，而且终身年金计划保证派发年金直至终老。换言之，退休人士便毋须担心寿命太长而耗尽退休金。当然，终身年金计划的上限只有100万元，每年预期最多只收到6万至7万元的年金是否足够，则见仁见智。计划规模料逐步扩大政府推出这个计划的同时，亦有很多考虑，所以开始时的规模也不能太大。随着计划渐趋成熟，市民的接受程度提高，笔者相信政府会逐步增加计划的规模。而且，透过公共年金计划引起的讨论和相关宣传及教育工作，亦可以让市民对年金有更多的认识，情形就好像当初推出iBond一样。当然，单靠政府是不足以提供足够的深度给所有的退休人士，所以，私人市场年金计划的配合是非常重要。笔者相信政府此举有助推动并优化私人市场的年金产品，毕竟政府没有收取行政费和管理费，如果私人市场的年金产品收费偏高而回报不吸引，产品的吸引力便会减少。总括而言，政府推行的终身年金计划是一个即时年金计划，对于拥有一笔现金的退休人士是一个好消息。作者为康宏理财助理联席董事，为《信报》/信网撰文，分享理财心得。

","Annuity Rate Not Equal to Internal Rate of Return Earlier in the history, the HKMC announced the launch of a ""life annuity plan"", also known as the ""public annuity plan."" Currently, work on the implementation of the plan is under way and is expected to be launched in the next year. Recently, I received a lot of customers on the program inquiries, there are many of my friends around the plan a little knowledge; therefore, I try to explain briefly, and took the opportunity to express some personal opinions on this plan. After all, until now, the plan has not yet been finalized and all details are yet to be announced officially. The target of the scheme is people over the age of 65 who, after putting a one-off premium, can receive their annuity until the one hundredth anniversary. The planned premium amount to be accepted is tentatively set at $ 50,000 to $ 1 million. According to a preliminary estimate by the HKMC, assuming that the internal rate of return is between 3% and 4%, men are insured at 65. The premium for every $ 100,000 is expected to be charged from $ 500 to $ 580 a month, or $ 6000 to $ 6960 a year , The annual rate of about 6% to 7%; women at 65 years of insurance, the monthly premium of 100,000 yuan per 450,000 yuan to 530 yuan, that is, annual annuity of 5,400 to 6,360 yuan, the annuity rate of about 5.4% to 6.4 %. The annuities received by men and women are different because of their different life expectancy and longer life expectancy for men than men. According to the figures above, one may mistake the annualized rate of return of the life-long annuity plan by 6% to 7%. They even compared it with some real estate funds (REITs) that pay dividends of 4% to 5% In comparison, the return of the life annuity plan is even more attractive. In fact, they confused the relationship between the annuity rate and the internal rate of return. In financial affairs, we used to call internal rate of
Rate of
Return or IRR), it is generally referred to as the rate of return. It is conceivable that a longevity annuity plan is a dividend-paying instrument that reduces the principal all the time when the insured receives the annuity. The annuity will not be repaid until the policyholder returns to the old one hundred years. Therefore, the annual distribution rate of 6% to 7% is not equal to the actual rate of return. At present, the assumed rate of return is only 3 % To 4%. Actually, the role of annuities is to provide retirees with a steady income so that they will not be scared of their investments after retirement. Everyone knows that there is a risk to both property and stocks. In the event of a stock market crash or a property market downturn, market volatility tends to exert some pressure on retirees. Conversely, annuities provide simple cash income, and the life annuity plan guarantees the payment of an annuity until it reaches its final age. In other words, retirees do not have to worry about running out of retirement pensions for too long. Of course, the maximum age limit of the longevity annuity plan is only $ 1 million. It is a matter of opinion that there should be a maximum of $ 60,000 to $ 70,000 annuities expected each year. While the scale of the project is expected to gradually expand While the government has introduced this plan, many considerations have also been taken. Therefore, the initial scale should not be too large. As the plan matures and the public's acceptance level rises, I believe the government will gradually increase the scale of the project. Moreover, the discussions and related publicity and education initiatives raised through the public annuity scheme can also give citizens more understanding of the annuity, just as it did when iBond was launched. Of course, relying solely on the government is not enough to provide sufficient depth to all retirees. Therefore, the co-ordination of the private market pension scheme is very important. I believe the government's move will help promote and optimize the annuity products in the private market. After all, the government will not charge administrative fees and management fees. If private-sector annuity product charges are too high and returns are not attractive, the attractiveness of the products will be reduced. To sum up, the government-run life-long annuity scheme is an instant annuity scheme and is good news for retirees who have a sum of cash.

","Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Bay Area Opportunity Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macau, Tai Wan District will be key national development projects. The aim is to create a fourth international bay area behind the United States New York Bay Area, San Francisco Bay Area and the Gulf of Japan. The characteristic of the Bay Area is to form a large and dynamic economic system through coordination among different cities and insufficient complementary roles. In my opinion, if we are to make long-term plans for the economic development of Hong Kong in the future, we must not lose the opportunity to immediately participate in the construction of the Tai Wan area in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau. However, during the process of participation, we have a series of questions that must be answered clearly so as to obtain the maximum benefit more effectively. First of all, what is the positioning of Hong Kong in the Bay Area? Obviously, in the past few days, individual cities have focused and achieved some success after clearly identifying their economic development roles, such as Shenzhen. In recent years, Shenzhen has focused on innovation and high-end science and technology and has successfully attracted many industry giants such as Tencent Holdings Limited and Huawei as their headquarters, and has become a place where people all over the world are willing to join the ranks of science and technology professionals. The technology industry has become the locomotive of Shenzhen economy. In contrast, in Hong Kong, due to the failure of mentality in the early years, we have lagged far behind in the development of the Chuangke Industry. The rise of Shenzhen in recent years deserves our reflection. If we are to catch up and create a platform for the innovation and technology industries, will we be able to get a share of the economy in the future? If the answer is yes, we must target it and strive for the Central Government's support for us in Hong Kong. At least there is an advantage in positioning and no disadvantage in the future. Targeting to Support Hong Kong's Advantages in the Past In the financial industry, the author foresaw that we have the legal system and regulatory regime recognized by the world. In the future, the listing of mainland innovative technology companies in Hong Kong will continue to be the trend. However, apart from the financial sector, can we explore other industry advantages, such as service industries, innovative technology products and markets, to provide business opportunities for our various types of professional services? Accounting, patent management and other industries will benefit? In the past, some friends complained that although the economic development in the Mainland was rapid, it failed to benefit the general public. This time, we must carefully examine the situation in the process of building the Bay Area. In the next few years, various transport connections to the Mainland will be gradually completed. The objective characteristics of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Taiwan High Speed ​​Rail Corporation are that the traffic distance will be shortened and whether or not population mobility will be promoted. The problem. In short, will mainland talents be able to work in Hong Kong and live in cities within the Bay Area or, conversely, Hong Kong people will find generous and promising work in the Bay Area, living in Hong Kong and even in the cities of the Bay Area? When this problem affects the taxation issue, can Hong Kong permanent residents who choose to settle in the Bay Area to work in Hong Kong from Hong Kong in the future be able to relax their restriction on the number of Hong Kong days so that they can pay Hong Kong tax? This is also the scope to be explored. Of course, people living in every area will consider local medical and educational facilities. According to the information provided, the medical and education industries in the future Bay Area are also key industries for cultivation. In the long run, if there is a substantial increase in the quality of the industry, the quality assurance will help enhance the desire to work and live in the local area. These are all issues that must be answered clearly in the future when implementing the construction of the Bay Area. Zhou Hao Ding Legislative Councilor

三星电子移动业务主管高东真23日上午10时在首尔公司总部召开记者会，公布针对停产手机Galaxy
Note7起火事件的调查结果。高东真表示，Note7自燃由电池缺陷引发，手机其他软硬件没有问题。高东真介绍，为还原燃损过程，三星在此次调查中测试了20万部手机和3万块电池，发现Note7所配两种电池存在不同的缺陷。三星在Note7中采用了自家和中国新能源科技有限公司生产的电池，但在当天记者会上，并未言及特定合作企业的名称。有观测曾经认为，三星Note7起火或源于手机本身设计或软件缺陷，此次三星公布的结果与此截然不同。高东真表示，过去数月的时间里，为了彻查起火原因，三星对Note7的硬件、软件，以及质检、物流、库存等相关流程的所有环节进行了排查。为了还原在用户使用时发生的燃损现象，找到确切原因，三星还特别配备了大规模的充放电装置。高东真说，在产品面市之前，未能检测出电池设计和制造流程上的问题，三星对此负有责任。三星方面还介绍称，国内外专业机构也同样指出Note7的起火原因在于电池缺陷。美国认证机构UL认为，三星SDI电池右上角有被挤压现象，由隔离膜过薄引发起火。中国新能源科技公司生产的电池接口部分出现异常扭曲、未黏贴绝缘胶带、隔离膜过薄等组件中的问题引发短路现象。美国另一家认证机构Exponent的调查结果和UL基本一致。Exponent认为，三星SDI电池存在阴极膜损伤，新能源科技公司的电池存在电极板扭曲导致绝缘胶带和隔离膜受损到引发起火。德国认证公司TUV
Rheinland针对Note7制造流程和电池物流系统进行集中调查，结果显示，未发现存在有损电池安全性的因素。三星电子强调，为了不让类似Note7停产事件重演，在大幅提高智能手机安全性方面制定了方针。高东真表示，向用户、电信运营商、流通合作商等表示由衷的歉意，为了重拾各方信任，在智能手机开发、制造、测试等所有流程方面制定了综合对策，防止类似事件重演。三星推出了""8重电池安全检查措施""，具体包括安全和持久性检查、外观检查、X光检查、拆解检查、TVOC检查、充放电检查以及用户使用场景下的加速测试等。与此同时，三星组建零部件专业小组，专门负责核心零部件的设计、测试和流程管理，引进更多外部专家，组建客观评估产品安全性的咨询小组。（完）zhanglili456@yna.co.kr【版权归韩联社所有，未经授权严禁转载复制】

Samsung Electronics mobile director Gao Dongzhen at 10:00 on the 23rd held a press conference in Seoul's corporate headquarters announced the release of China Galaxy Securities Co.,Ltd.
Note7 fire incident investigation results. Gao Dongzhen said that Note7 spontaneous combustion caused by a battery defect, the phone does not have any other hardware and software problems. High East really introduced, in order to restore the process of burning, Samsung in the survey tested 200,000 phones and 30,000 batteries found Note7 equipped with two kinds of batteries have different defects. Samsung used its own battery in China Note7 and China New Energy Technology Co.,Ltd. However, at the press conference of the day, it did not mention the name of a specific cooperative enterprise. Some observations once thought that the Samsung Note7 fire or from the phone itself, design or software defects, the results announced by Samsung and this is completely different. Gao Dongzhen said that in the past few months, in order to thoroughly investigate the cause of the fire, Samsung conducted a check on all aspects of Note7 hardware and software, as well as quality inspection, logistics, inventory and other related processes. In order to restore the user to use when the phenomenon of burning to find the exact cause, Samsung is also equipped with a large-scale charge and discharge devices. High East really said that before the product is available, failed to detect the battery design and manufacturing process problems, Samsung is responsible for this. Samsung also said that the domestic and foreign professional bodies also pointed out that the cause of the Note7 fire lies in battery defects. UL recognized by the United States certification body, Samsung SDI CORPORATION battery has been squeezed in the upper right corner of the phenomenon, caused by the film is too thin fire. China's new energy technology company's battery interface part of the abnormal distortion, not adhesive insulation tape, the film is too thin and other components of the problem caused by short circuit. The findings of Exponent, another U.S. certification agency, are basically in line with UL's. Exponent believes that the Samsung SDI CORPORATION batteries have a cathode film damage, the new energy technology company's battery there is distortion of the electrode plate leads to insulation tape and the insulation film damaged to cause a fire. German certification company TUV
Rheinland focused on the Note7 manufacturing process and battery logistics system and found no factors that could detriment the battery's safety. Samsung Electronics stressed that in order not to let a similar Note7 shutdown event repeat itself, in the substantial increase in the safety of smart phones set a policy. Gao Dongzheng said he sincerely apologized to users, telecom operators, distribution partners and so on. In order to regain the trust of all parties, a comprehensive strategy has been formulated for all processes of smartphone development, manufacturing and testing to prevent similar incidents from recurring. Samsung introduced the ""eight heavy battery safety inspection measures"", specifically including safety and durability checks, visual inspection, X-ray inspection, disassembly inspection, TVOC inspection, charge and discharge checks and acceleration tests under user scenarios. In the meantime, Samsung has set up a component team to take charge of the design, testing and process management of core components, introduce more external experts and set up an advisory group to objectively evaluate product safety.

I164baef0339211e7ae2c882f55fa2a1f.1C,"铜臭青瓦台 即将易主 南韩明总统大选
财阀制度势改革南韩总统选举将于明天（周二）举行，在前总统朴槿惠因闺密干政和涉嫌收受财阀贿赂而遭弹劾拘捕后，染上铜臭的青瓦台即将易主。民调领先的大热门总统候选人文在寅，呼吁改革南韩家族式财阀企业的经营管理模式。总统大选声势领先的候选人是六十四岁的左倾共同民主党前党魁、人权律师文在寅，他主张与北韩对话，并誓言不会再有过去赦免企业罪犯的做法，且要打破政商勾结局面。文在寅的经济顾问金尚祚说，他的矛头指向四大集团，分别是三星、现代汽车、鲜京（SK）和乐金（LG）。文在寅的财阀改革政策的关键是，由小股东和董事们施压，以促使这些家族财团改善经营管理，即将小股东提名董事的权力扩大。五十五岁中间偏左国民之党前党魁、前医生兼有「南韩盖兹」之称的总统候选人安哲秀，誓言为改革而奋斗。他也主张抑制财阀，曾多次批评南韩贫富悬殊，并常以「三星动物园」、「LG动物园」等，批评大财阀对中小企业的不公平交易。文在寅：不赦免企业罪犯南韩民众要求改革国家经济体制的呼声高企，他们不满政府与大财团勾结，举行多月示威，导致朴槿惠在三月被罢免，涉嫌行贿的三星集团实际掌权人李在鎔被捕。各主要总统候选人均试图回应民众对经济不公平、年轻人失业率高企的不满。南韩过去也曾出现要求财阀改革的呼声，但这些财阀的规模和势力却有增无减。根据南韩证交所资料，四大财阀佔南韩股市市值约五成。周二总统大选后的问题将是，此次财阀改革的力度会有多大，青瓦台新主人是否会处理财阀令人诟病的经营管理核心难题，即集团创办家族所掌管各公司複杂的交叉持股现象。邓普顿新兴市场集团执行董事长莫比尔斯说，「我认为，南韩人民的态度大致上已有巨大变化，因此财阀改革的成功机率已提高」；但他也强调，「由于财阀对南韩的经济仍很重要，我们不能期待很快就有结果」。批评者指出，一九九七至一九九八年的金融风暴虽大幅改变财团的会计方法和经营管理，却未能切断政商共生关係，也未改变三星和现代等财阀的交叉持股现象。韩国科学技术学院教授张世珍（音译）指出，南韩不可能像美国麦克阿瑟将军二战后在日本那样拆解财阀，下任总统要做的是强化董事会功能以及股东行使权利的能力。南韩举国上下都想在这次大选中选出一位好总统领导目前面临内外交困的国家。在首尔经营照像馆达四十一年的金柱镐表示，这次的选举希望能选出一位不论党派立场、能使老百姓安居乐业、具有高度国家安保意识的总统，特别是，现在经济较为困窘，希望新总统能提振经济、稳定社会、巩固国防。近日民调显示，文在寅支持率达百分之四十二点四，执政自由韩国党候选人洪准杓与安哲秀同为百分之十八点六，并列第二。

","Brass blue tile is imminent South Korean presidential election
Chaebol Institutional Reform South Korea's presidential election will be held tomorrow (Tuesday) after the former President Pu Geun-hui was arrested on charges of girlfriend administration and suspicion of accepting bribes from chaebol. Wen Zaiyin, a popular presidential candidate who is leading the polls, called for the reform of the management mode of South Korean family-owned chaebol enterprises. The leading candidate for the presidential election is the 44-year-old leftist Common Democrat former leader, human rights lawyer Wen Zaiyan. He advocates dialogue with North Korea and vowed not to pardon corporate criminals in the past. He also wants to break the political collusion situation . Kim Soo-hyun, a financial adviser to Wen, says he spearheaded four big groups, namely Samsung, Hyundai, SK and LG. The key to Wen's chaebol reform policy is that pressure is being placed on minority shareholders and directors to help these family consortia improve their operations and management and to expand the power of minority shareholders to nominate directors. Anzhe Hsiu, a former party leader and a former doctor known as ""South Korea's Gatszazi"", a 55-year-old middle-left leftist, vowed to fight for reform. He also advocated restraining chaebol and repeatedly criticized the disparity between the rich and the poor in South Korea. He often criticized the chaebol trading unfair trade practices for small and medium-sized enterprises with ""Samsung Zoo"" and ""LG Zoo."" Wen Yinyin: Not forgiving corporate criminals South Korea's public demand for reform of the national economic system is high, they dissatisfied with the government collusion with the big consortia, held more than a month of demonstrations, resulting in Park Geun-hye was dismissed in March, the actual charge of the Samsung Group suspected of bribery Li Rong was arrested. All major presidential candidates are trying to respond to public dissatisfaction with the unfair economy and the high unemployment rate among young people. In the past, South Korea also called for the chaebol reform. However, the size and power of these chaebol increased. According to the information of the South Korea Stock Exchange, the four chaebol accounts for about 50% of the market value of the South Korean stock market. The question after Tuesday's presidential election will be whether the chaebol reform will be strong and whether the new owner of the Cheong Wa Dae dealt with the critically acclaimed core issue of chaebol management, namely the complex cross-shareholdings of the companies founded by the family-run companies . ""I think the attitude of the South Korean people has changed substantially in general and the chances of success of the chaebol reform have risen."" However, he also stressed that ""as the chaebol pair,"" said Mobiles, executive chairman of the market group for SINCERE NAVIGATION CORPORATION in Templeton. The economy of South Korea is still very important and we can not expect to see any results soon. "" Critics point out that the financial turmoil of 1997-98, while drastically changing the accounting methods and management of the consortia, failed to cut off the symbiotic relationship between the government and commerce and did not change the cross-shareholdings of the chaebol such as Samsung and Hyundai. Zhang Shizhen, a professor at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, said that it is impossible for South Korea to dismantle the chaebol like General MacArthur in Japan in the post-World War II period. What the next President wants to do is to strengthen the board's functions and shareholders' ability to exercise their rights. South Korea wants to elect a good president in this election from all over the country facing the current internal and external difficulties. Kim Soo-ho, who runs the photostudio for 41 years in Seoul, said the election hopes to elect a president with a high degree of national security awareness to live and work in the Laobaixing Pharmacy Chain Joint Stock Company, regardless of his party's position. In particular, Now that the economy is more embarrassing, I hope the new president can boost the economy, stabilize the society and consolidate national defense. Recently, polls showed Wen Yimin's support rate of 42.4 percent, and Hong Kong's governing Republican candidate Jonathan and An Zhexiu both held the second position with 18.6 percent.",铜臭青瓦台 即将易主 南韩明总统大选 财阀制度势改革,Not Reuters,10:41PM 03 Sep 2017,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I164baef0339211e7ae2c882f55fa2a1f.1C.html

I16bf2110e86e11e6866884605e69fe91.1C,"《缸边娴谈－黄惠娴》玖纸（０２６８９）发盈喜
《缸边娴谈》玖龙纸业（０２６８９）于２０１７年１月２３日公布，未经审计，截至２０１６年１２月３１日止六个月，集团核心盈利（即指撇除经营和融资活动（扣除税项）的汇兑盈利或亏损后，集团权益持有人应占盈利）较去年同期的１３．２２亿元增长不低于４５％。期内集团汇兑亏损较去年同期大幅度下降。集团的核心盈利增长主要因为：一是销量增加，集团于期内的包装纸板和环保型文化用纸销售量均达到历史新高，升至约７１０万吨，较去年同期增加约４０万吨；二是成本压力转嫁能力加强。集团表示，虽然期内集团两项主要原料－废纸及煤炭的销售价格上升而令集团的成上上涨，但集团通过有效上调产品销售价格以转嫁成本上涨的压力予客户。而转嫁能力的增强主要由于政府环保政策和执法收紧，令包装纸行业产能关闭加快，及中国制造业信心的逐步恢复所致。＊优化债务结构减轻债务成本及汇兑亏损负担＊
另外，中期核心盈利增长亦因为去年集团在面对人民币减息及贬值趋势，集团采取更加灵活的财务政策，去年上半年将大部分美元贷款转为人民币或欧元贷款后，于下半年加速将所持有的欧元贷款转换为人民币贷款，化减汇兑风险，能有效显着减少外币债务于汇兑上有可能出现的亏损。现时集团已将债务组合中的人民币债务占比提升至７０％以上。相信在波动的外汇市场中集团将债务结构优化能纾缓盈利的负面影响，加上集团的阶段发展计划大致完成及利率差距已明显收窄下，集团已开始大幅度减债及降低借贷成本，这有助集团改善盈利。＊产能提升＊
集团已计划越南基地的新纸机将于２０１７年６月底前投产，届时集团总设计年产能将达到１４０８万吨。而渖阳基地的第二台纸机预计将于２０１８年６月底前完成投产。两台新纸机陆续投产，巩固了玖龙在各个区域的龙头地位，形成规模化生产，优化成本，提升效益。
在深化改革下，行业开始形成新的供需平衡关系，更多的落后及低效率产能被关停，而新增产能较过去大量减少，中国箱板原纸行业持续改善，产品价格于２０１６年度保持上升势头，即使在相对的澹季期间亦能维持稳定。集团主席张茵去年底表示，现时集团的存货周转天数已由过往的１０天降至５天，是自２００８年以来的新低，存货周转天数的下降，相信是行业整合已基本见底，预计纸业市场２０１７年首季将会更趋平稳。行业不断整合，造纸行业的逐步回暖，集团亦逐扩大产能，玖龙纸业作为内地最大的箱板纸生产商，相信可受惠行业逐步复苏之下。投资者可考虑于８．３元附近的位置增持或吸纳，中长线目标价为港币１０．１８元。《工银亚洲证券业务部分析员

NINE DRAGONS PAPER HOLDINGS LIMITED Paper (02689) announced on January 23, 2017 that, unaudited, for the six months ended December 31, 2016, the Group's core profit (ie, write-down Profit attributable to equity holders of the Group increased by no less than 45% as compared to RMB1,322 million in the same period of last year except for the gain or loss on exchange of operations and financing activities (net of tax). During the period, the Group's exchange loss greatly decreased over the same period of last year. The core profit growth of the Group was mainly attributable to the following reasons: First, the sales volume increased. The sales volume of packaging paperboard and environment-friendly cultural paper reached a historical high of about 7.1 million tons during the period, an increase of about 400,000 tons over the same period of last year. Is the cost pressure to shift the ability to strengthen. The Group said that despite the rising sales prices of its two main raw materials, namely waste paper and coal, the Group increased its selling prices so as to pass on the pressure of rising costs to its customers. The enhanced ability to pass on was mainly due to the tightening of government environmental protection policies and enforcement, the closure of production capacity in the packaging paper industry and the gradual restoration of confidence in the manufacturing industry in China. * Optimize debt structure to reduce debt cost and exchange loss burden *
In addition, the growth of the medium-term core profit was also due to the fact that the Group adopted a more flexible financial policy in the face of the trend of RMB interest rate cut and devaluation last year. After the majority of US dollar loans were converted into RMB or euro loans in the first half of last year, the Group accelerated its operation in the second half of the year The conversion of the held Euro loans into RMB loans reduces the foreign exchange risk and effectively reduces the possible losses on foreign currency debt. At present, the Group has raised the proportion of RMB debt in its debt portfolio to more than 70%. Believing that in the volatile foreign exchange market the Group will optimize its debt structure to mitigate the negative impact of its earnings and the Group has substantially completed its phase development plan and the interest rate gap has narrowed markedly, the Group has started to substantially reduce its debt and reduce borrowing costs, This will help the group improve its profitability. * Capacity increase *
The Group has planned to start production of new paper machines in Vietnam's base by the end of June 2017, when the total designed annual production capacity of the Group will reach 14.08 million tons. The second machine at Shenyang base is expected to be completed and put into operation by the end of June 2018. Two new paper machines were put into operation one after another, consolidating the leading position of NINE DRAGONS PAPER (HOLDINGS) LIMITED in various regions, forming a large-scale production, optimizing costs and enhancing efficiency.
Under the deepening reform, the industry started to form a new balance of supply and demand. More backward and inefficient production capacity was shut down while new production capacity was substantially reduced compared with the past. Continued improvement in the container paper base industry in China continued to result in a rise in product prices in FY16 The momentum remains stable even during the relative 澹 season. Group chairman Zhang Yin said at the end of last year, the current inventory turnover days has dropped from the previous 10 days to 5 days, is the lowest since 2008, inventory turnover days decline, I believe the industry consolidation has bottomed out, is expected Paper The market will be more stable in the first quarter of 2017. As the industry continues to consolidate and the paper industry picks up gradually, the Group also increases production capacity. As the largest containerboard manufacturer in the Mainland, NINE DRAGONS PAPER (HOLDINGS) LIMITED believes that the beneficiary industries will gradually recover. Investors may consider adding or absorbing positions near 8.3 yuan, medium and long term target price of 10.18 yuan. ICBC Asia Securities analyst

I178dd43047d011e7b30880defb202d46.1C,"内地经济再寻底
挑战去槓杆决心中国在今年四月公布第一季经济增长出乎意料达百分之六点九之后，市场即时出现两种截然不同的解读，乐观的一方认定新的经济上升周期已降临；悲观的一方则担忧增长已见顶，之后会往低走。虽然第二季还有一个月才完结，具体数据更要到七月才揭晓，但愈来愈多迹象显示，悲观派并非杞人忧天，中国经济再次寻底的风险愈来愈大。中央对此应已有所警惕，一方面由官媒出面安抚市场，解释目前的状况是多个周期叠加的结果，属短期波动。另一方面，即时动用非常手段防乱，好像近日突然挟高人民币滙价及抽乾离岸市场资金，先下手为强把澹友驱杀；同时又在股市实施非常严厉的减持新规定，限制上市公司主要股东沽出股票，以免触发抛售潮。这些措施的用意，相信是预防一旦经济数据变得太坏触发市场恐慌，毕竟经济转弱可以来得相当快。就以刚出炉的五月份财新製造业採购经理指数（PMI）为例，跌至四十九点六，不但比预期差，更是十一个月以来首次堕进五十以下的收缩区间，反映製造业表现倒退。财新的经济学家直言，经济下行趋势已经基本确立，「稳中向好」的局面恐难持续。相对而言，国家统计局公布的官方PMI便好看得多，持平于五十一点二，仅大企业表现略为放缓，中小企业反而加速扩张，与财新的数据大相迳庭。财新会否因为缺乏「看齐意识」及「大局观」，往后不得再发布自家指数，绝非不可能，但这是后话了。不过，只要细看官方及财新PMI中的分项指数，除了库存分项差异较大之外，其他分项指数所反映的事实并无太大出入，需求、生产、价格及招聘等一律转弱，部分更回到去年中的水平，即是本轮经济见底回升的起点。由此推断，稍后公布的其他数据，例如固定资产投资、工业增加值、企业利润、生产物价及零售等，皆面对下行压力。究竟这些现象只属短期波动，抑或经济再次寻底？还是保持审慎为上策。有不少意见归咎，经济表现从第一季的高峰回落，与今年以来实施金融强监管及加速去槓杆有很大关係。中国稳增长的方程式其实很简单，当经济有下行压力，便会由各级政府带头增加投资，同时放鬆银根，结果必定会推高整体的债务槓杆；现时情况反过来要去槓杆，自然造成银根收紧，市场利率上升，投资热情减退，结果是经济增速放缓。自环球爆发金融海啸，中国于二○○八年推出四万亿元人民币刺激经济方桉以来，内地大概每隔两三年，便会因应经济回扬及投资过热而来一次宏观调控，例如二○一○年整治地方融资平台，二○一三年整治商业银行的非标准化投资产品，二○一五年整治非法融资配资，到二○一七年则是金融去槓杆。从中不难看到一个几近固定的规律，就是因前一段时间投资泛滥，金融风险不断累积，迫使当局出手严加调控，务求经济顽疾标本兼治；可是当经济开始下行，又担心降温力度过大，调控便戛然而止，立刻掉头稳增长。由于这「鬆紧模式」周而复始，难怪市场不断猜测当前的一轮强监管及去槓杆应该很快落幕，但今时跟往日又会否不一样呢？近年几次宏观调控，重点离不开消灭过剩产能、改善投资效率、防范金融风险、推动产业转型升级、提高经济质量等，今年则着重金融去槓杆，为供给侧改革护航，内容其实大同小异，最终能否打破半途而废的宿命，成就改革大业，有两点应引以为戒。首先，改革不能以新瓶包装旧酒，必须严防以创新为名继续滥发贷款，催谷基建及资产泡沫等，否则只会重蹈覆辙。其次，在一党专政体制下，施政的认受性，主要是看民众能够分享多少经济成果，必须先说服他们忍受短痛来换取长远经济效益，否则随时造成社会不稳。如果中国经济真的再次下潜，现在只是起点，随着金融强监管和持续去槓杆，再过一两季，当基建及房地产投资增速也开始减慢，消费又未见跃升，届时将真正考验中央坚持改革的决心

","Mainland economy and then find the bottom
Challenge De-Leveraged Determined China released two completely different interpretations of the market immediately after its unexpected growth of 6.9% in the first quarter of this year in April this year. The optimistic party concluded that the new cycle of economic upturn has come; pessimism One side is concerned about the growth has peaked, then go low. Although there is only a month in the second quarter to be completed, the specific data should not be disclosed until July. However, there are more and more signs that the pessimists are not without their worries and the risk of China's economy finding its way again is getting bigger and bigger. The central authorities should have been wary of this. On the one hand, the official media came to appease the market and explained that the current situation is the result of multiple periodic overlaps and is a short-term fluctuation. On the other hand, the immediate use of extraordinary means to prevent chaos seems to have relied heavily on the high exchange rate of RMB and the offshore market for money. First, it has taken the lead to force its friends to kill. At the same time, it has implemented a very severe reduction of new provisions in the stock market, Limit the major shareholders of listed companies to sell the stock, so as not to trigger a sell-off. The intentions of these measures, which are believed to be prevention, can trigger a market panic once economic data becomes too bad, after all, the weakening of the economy can come quite quickly. Taking the newly released PMI for May, the new manufacturing PMI, for example, fell to 49.6 not only worse than expected but also fallen below 50 for the first time in 11 months , Reflecting the manufacturing performance retrogression. Choi new economists bluntly, the economic downturn has been basically established, ""steady and good"" situation is unlikely to continue. Relatively speaking, the official PMI released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China was much better than the previous one, unchanged at 51.2. However, the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises only slightly slowed down. However, SMEs accelerated their expansion, which greatly contrasted with the new data of Cai Xin. It is by no means impossible for Caixin not to post its own index for the future because of its lack of ""awareness of alignment"" and ""overall situation."" However, this is an afterword. However, as long as we look at the sub-indices in official and Caixin PMIs, apart from the large differences in sub-items in inventories, the sub-indices reflected by the other sub-indices are not much different in terms of demand, production, prices and recruitment Weak, some more back to the level of last year, that is, this round of economic bottoming out of the starting point. It follows that other data to be released later, such as fixed asset investment, industrial added value, corporate profits, producer prices and retail sales, are all under downward pressure. After all, these phenomena are only short-term fluctuations, or economic search for the bottom again? Still cautious as a policy. Many opinions have been attributed to the fact that economic performance has dropped from the peak in the first quarter and there is a great relationship between this year's implementation of the strong financial supervision and the acceleration of deleveraging. The formula for China's steady growth is actually very simple. When there is downward pressure on the economy, governments at all levels take the lead in increasing investment while easing monetary policy. As a result, it will surely push up the overall debt leverage. In the present situation, Tightening, the market interest rate rose, investment enthusiasm subsided, the result is a slowdown in economic growth. Since the outbreak of the financial tsunami in the world and China's introduction of 4 trillion yuan in stimulating economic programs in 2008, the Mainland will probably conduct a macro-control in response to the economic recovery and overheating of investment every two to three years. For example, ○ Remediation of local financing platforms in 2010, reorganization of non-standardized investment products of commercial banks in 2013, financing of illegal financing in remediation in 2015 and de-leveraging of finance in 2017. It is not hard to see a nearly fixed law, that is, due to the flooding of investment in the previous period and the continuous accumulation of financial risks, the authorities have been forced to strictly control their operations in order to tackle the root causes of economic problems. However, when the economy starts to go down and is worried about the excessive cooling, Control will abrupt end, immediately turn around and steady growth. As the ""elastic mode"" is going round the clock, it is no wonder that the market continually guesses that the current round of strong regulation and deleveraging should soon come to an end. However, will this be the same as the previous one? In recent years, the macroeconomic regulation and control can not be separated from elimination of excess capacity, improvement of investment efficiency, prevention of financial risks, promotion of industrial transformation and upgrading and improvement of economic quality. This year, however, the emphasis is placed on financial leverage and on the supply side, which is more or less the same. Whether we can break the deadliest fate and achieve the great cause of the reform should be taken as a guide. First of all, the reform can not be used to pack old wine in new bottles. It is necessary to prevent loans from spilling over, infrastructure and asset bubbles in the name of innovation, or they will only repeat the same mistakes. Secondly, under the one-party dictatorship system, the acceptance of governance mainly depends on how much economic results the people can share. They must first persuade them to endure the short-term pain in exchange for long-term economic benefits or social instability will be caused at any time. If China's economy really dives again, it is only the starting point now. With strong regulation over the financial sector and continued deleveraging, in the next one or two quarters, as infrastructure and real estate investment growth begin to slow down and consumption has not escalated, real Test the determination of the central government to adhere to the reform

常用语言相关的课程。环顾香港大学教资会（UGC）资助的八所大学所提供的语言培训课程，有八所教授华语、英语、日语、韩语及法语、七所教授西班牙语及德语、四所提供阿拉伯语及俄语，三所设有意大利语及泰语、两所提供葡语、只有一所教授希腊语及瑞典语。阿拉伯语、英语及俄语是「一带一路」最普遍使用的官方语言，不过现时本地的阿拉伯语及俄语的课程不多，而且内容略为简浅，要利用所学所得去联繫沿
的阿拉伯国家，恐怕难以称职。另一缓冲方法是政府资助本地学生到国外交流学习，待他们学成之后，回港成为两地通商的催化器。然而，本地学生对于大部分「一带一路」沿
国家的历史和文化都认识不深，因此他们对去那些地方求学并不积极。笔者认为不单止是大学，香港要从中小学开始便要加强有关这些国家的教育。这做法亦不是纯粹为了「一带一路」而设，同时也可以扩阔学生的视野及世界观。招「带路」学生利通商再者，既然香港相关的外语教育水平还有待改进，各大学可考虑招收更多「一带一路」沿
国家学生来港修读本科或研究生课程。此举既可提升语文（主要是英语和华语）训练，同时可以体验形式让外国学生了解香港及内地，待他们毕业回国之后，以香港为基地与中国通商。实际上，这做法并非新鲜，并且行之有效。中央政府多年来邀请（甚至乎资助）过不少非洲学生来中国读书。大多毕业生回国工作，变相成为中方的商务使者，帮助促进两地的跨国生意。在这策略的推动之下，今天中国企业在非洲各地拥有庞大的投资及大型基建项目。不过，此举若要在香港执行的话，香港政府需要放宽外来学生的学额，以及建设相关配套设施。笔者更建议政府加大力度推广之前所设立的十亿港元「一带一路奖学金」，积极吸引更多沿
精英学生来港求学，毕业后协助香港做好「一带一路」超级联繫人这份工。黄锦辉教授香港专业及资深行政人员协会副会长香港资讯科技联会前会长香港中文大学工程学院副院长（外务）

","Promote ""One Belt and One Road"" development
First Breaking the Language Barrier The ""two sessions"" have been successfully concluded. One of the focal points of the conference can not be separated from the implementation of the ""13th Five-Year Plan"" by the state. Among them, ""the Belt and Road"" is an issue of economic development that is of special concern to Guangdong, Hong Kong, Maucao and Taiwan. However, can Hong Kong play a role of ""super-contact"" in language and culture with the development of ""One Belt, One Road""? The ""One Belt, One Road"" foreign development plan is a key policy of the country's sustained economic development. Scholars both at home and abroad have stated spontaneously that it will inevitably find it hard to reach full ""one road, one road"" exchange. In many difficulties, the author believes that language barriers between countries are particularly crucial issues. For example along
The differences in language among businessmen in various countries inevitably result in communication problems during business transactions, resulting in unnecessary disputes. As a whole, it is possible to talk about trade exchanges, cultural exchanges and people-to-people interaction only when they are connected to each other. Therefore, the construction of the ""One Belt and One Road"" must not overlook language considerations. This demand poses multiple challenges to Hong Kong's plan to play the role of ""super-contact"" in the ""Belt and Road"". From education
Strengthening communication According to the Chinese Social Science Journal and the ""One Belt and Six Roads"" along sixty-six countries using more than two thousand languages, as many as eight hundred languages, as can be seen along the
The language environment is very complicated. Along the Belt and Road
The official language used by most people is Arabic, accounting for 14 countries (including most Muslim-speaking countries); English, followed by Singapore, including five countries; followed by Russian (including Russia and other former Soviet Union regions Four countries). The report even pointed out that along
Twelve countries use more than one official language, the most complicated of which is Singapore. It uses English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil, for a total of four official languages. In a nutshell, the ""Belt and Road"" along
The official language of a total of fifty-four kinds, this diversity of language phenomenon highlights the edge
The complexity of language barriers. The author believes that the prerequisite for Hong Kong to participate in becoming a super-contact of the ""One Belt One Road"" is to break through the language barrier and the solution to this problem needs from education
hand. First of all, major institutions in Hong Kong can provide more and along the ""One Belt and One Road""
Common language-related courses. Looking at the language training courses offered by eight universities funded by Unigroup Guoxin Co.,Ltd.,there are eight professors in Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean and French, seven in Spanish and German, Available in Arabic and Russian, three in Italian and Thai, two in Portuguese, and only one in Greek and Swedish. Arabic, English and Russian are the most commonly used official languages ​​of the ""One Belt and Road"". However, there are not enough courses in Arabic and Russian at present, and the content is rather simple. We should use what we have learned to link
Arab countries, I am afraid difficult to be competent. Another method of cushioning is that the government subsidizes local students to study abroad. After they have completed their studies, they will return to Hong Kong as a catalyst for trade between the two places. However, most local students are along the Belt and Road
The history and culture of the country are not well known, so they are not active in going to those places. I think that not only universities but also primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong will have to strengthen their education in these countries. Nor is it just a matter of ""one belt, one road"". At the same time, it is also possible to broaden students' horizons and worldview. Recruiting Students to Lead the Way to Business Development Besides, since the standards of foreign language education in Hong Kong need to be improved, universities may consider enrolling more along the ""One Belt, Roads and One Road""
National students come to Hong Kong for undergraduate or postgraduate studies. This will enhance the training of Chinese (mainly English and Chinese) and will enable foreign students to learn about Hong Kong and the Mainland. After they graduate from their hometowns, they will conduct business in Hong Kong. In fact, this approach is not new and works well. Over the years, the Central Government has invited (or even subsidized) many African students to study in China. Most graduates returned to work in disguise to become China's business messengers, helping to promote cross-border business between the two places. Driven by this strategy, Chinese companies today have vast investment and large-scale infrastructure projects across Africa. However, if the move is to be implemented in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Government will need to relax the places for foreign students and build related facilities. The author suggests that the government should step up efforts to promote the one billion Hong Kong dollar ""Belt and Road Initiative Scholarship"" set up before by actively attracting more
 Elitegroup Computer Systems Co.,Ltd. Students come to Hong Kong for study after graduation to help Hong Kong be a super contact person for this One Belt and Road initiative.

I19720c80424911e7892c8a18c3537592.1C,"大摩：消费潜力在低端城市资料提供:
中港两地股市弹升后又回气，国企指数短綫有压力，但中綫仍然在寻顶。至于摩根士丹利认为内地低端城市是内地未来消费潜力所在，消费股中长綫上升空间大。
上证综合指数昨日高见3120点便回落，全日升2点，收报3110点；深证成分指数跌34点，收报9859点；沪深两指数成交额合计3,800亿元人民币，自然未能支持国企指数企于10600点之上，国指全日只升8点，收报10579点，成交额132亿元；而红筹指数跌15点，收报4056点，成交额48亿元。
国指昨日高见10652点便掉头回落，全日又只有101点波幅，相信是今日为周末假期，下周一期指结算后周二又放假，加上内地股市下周一、二休市，故在缺乏指标下，大市昨日没有方向也是预期之内，相信下周一情况跟昨日不会相差太远，或要等中港两地放完假后才有新方向。但从走势而言，却是「短回中升」的格局，因为国指昨日虽窄幅上落惟呈「陀螺」，而指数自2月以来，曾两度冲击10600点至10700点区间，2月高见10593点以「陀螺」见顶，3月高见10698点又同样出现「陀螺」，又是见顶，今次再冲这区间又出现「陀螺」，难免令人担心已见顶，下周可以揭晓，但下周一不宜出现大阴烛，否则会跟周四、五的走势组成「黄昏之星」，所以下周一压力不少。
当然，国指今次如挑战10700点失败，也会呈现「三顶」，又是一个反转型态，后市确实有小小隐忧，也令笔者担心A股今年入摩是否又失败。但幸好国指中期走势显示，指数2月和3月冲击10600点至10700点区域失败，周綫图显示出现「射击之星」和「陀螺」，配合日綫走势，但今周却是一枝大阳烛，跟日綫「陀螺」不同，这是一个变数，故要睇未来两周走势。因为指数过去三个月两度冲击250周綫（现处于10411点），从未试过连续三周收高于该綫，今次收于该綫之上是第一周。
随着大市可能要整固，下周或会是炒股不炒市的局面，尤其落后股或会受到重视，如消费板块。因为摩根士丹利昨日一份报告指出，一般人对内地消费的睇法是大城市才是重要的消费群体，但低端城市即小城市在未来10至15年会是中国消费热潮的主要动力，估计这些城市在2017年至2030年间佔内地私人消费增长的三分二，消费群体会转向服务消费，特别是旅游和出境旅游，以及医疗保健、家庭用品、休閒和互联网等。广汽万达IMAX可吼
报告解释，户籍改革令城市人口增加，但一綫城市人口增长停滞不前，低端城市到2030年可能会佔居民人口增长的75%至81%，更重要是低端城市的人均可支配收入，由2016年到2030年可增长84%至8,261美元，增速高于一、二綫城市的56%和71%；即使跟一、二綫城市在人均消费比较，低端城市增长1.2倍至6,771美元，一、二綫城市则增长82%和1倍，可显示低端城市未来的潜在消费力确实是大于一、二綫城市。至于低端城市居民会有较高的储蓄比率，可提高电子商务在家庭用户消费的普及率。
摩根士丹利睇好一系列的消费股，来自中国品牌、大众媒体、港澳、汽车、消閒、航空、能源和互联网等板块，如安踏体育（02020）、万达院綫（深：002739）、广汽集团（02238）、腾讯（00700）和阿里巴巴等，给予的的目标价较昨日收市价的潜在上升空间由7%至59%不等，以广汽和万达的目标最高，股民不妨留意。此外，该行在昨日的另一份报告中亦提及内地电影业，指市场目标过度集中在票房身上，反而忽略娱乐消费的未来长期增长会有15%的複合增长，尤其是低端城市的消费潜力大，所以除了睇好万达外，也睇好IMAX
CHINA（01970），给予目标价45元，只是潜在上升空间不及万达，但股民也可留意。 yeesiuman@hket.com

","Morgan Stanley: Potential for consumption in low-tier cities Source:
Stock markets in both Hong Kong and China rebounded after the rally. The short-term pressure of the state-owned enterprises index, but the midline is still looking for top. As Morgan Stanley believes that the mainland's low-end cities are the potential for future consumption in the Mainland, the consumer long-term upside in space.
The Shanghai Composite Index retreated from yesterday's high of 3120 and rose 2 points to end at 3110 points. The Shenzhen Component Index lost 34 points to close at 9859 points. The Shanghai-Shenzhen Composite Index recorded a total turnover of 380 billion yuan, which naturally failed to support the China Enterprises Index Above 10600, the H-Share Index only rose 8 points to close at 10,579 points with a turnover of 13.2 billion yuan. The Red Chip Index dropped 15 points to end at 4056 points, with a turnover of 4.8 billion yuan.
The H-Share Index yesterday saw a 10652 high and it turned around with only a 101-point volatility. I believe this is a weekend holiday today. Next Monday I mean holiday after the settlement. On the other hand, with the mainland stock market closed on Monday and the next Tuesday, No direction yesterday, the market is within the expected, I believe next Monday the situation will not go too far with yesterday, or to wait for China and Hong Kong to put off after the holiday there is a new direction. However, from the trend, it is a pattern of ""short rise and rise."" Although the index means ""gyro"" in a narrow range yesterday, and the index has hit 10600 to 10700 areas twice since February, February peak see 10593 points to ""gyro"" peaked in March to see 10698 points again appeared ""gyro"" is peaked again this time there again appear in this area ""gyro"", it is inevitable that people have been worried about the top, the next Weeks can be revealed, but next Monday should not be a large black candle, otherwise it will be formed with the trend of Thursday, Friday, ""Twilight Star"", so a lot of pressure next Monday.
Of course, if the H-Share Index fails to meet the challenge of 10,700 points this time, it will also show ""three tops"". This is another reversal pattern. The market outlook does have some minor worries and worries me that A shares will fail this year. But fortunately, the medium-term trend of the H-Share Index shows that the index hit 10,600 to 10,700 in February and March, failing. The weekly chart shows ""Shooting Star"" and ""Gyro"" in line with the daily trend but this week it was a big candle. , With the daily ""gyro"" different, this is a variable, it should watch the next two weeks trend. Since the index has hit the 250-week mark twice (now at 10411) in the past three months, it has never tried to close above that line for three consecutive weeks, and it is the first week above this line.
As the market may need to consolidate, next week or stocks may not speculation in the market situation, especially the outdone stocks may be taken seriously, such as consumer segments. Because Morgan Stanley pointed out in a report yesterday that the general public's consumption of the Mainland is an important consumer group in big cities. However, the low-end cities, that is, small cities, will be the main driving force of China's consumption boom in the next 10 to 15 years. It is estimated that these cities will make up two-thirds of the growth in private consumption in the Mainland between 2017 and 2030. Consumer groups will shift to service consumption, especially for tourism and outbound travel, as well as healthcare, household products, leisure and the Internet. Guangzhou Automobile Wanda IMAX can roar
The report explained that the household registration reform has brought about an increase in the urban population. However, population growth in first-tier cities has stagnated. Low-tier cities may account for 75% to 81% of the population growth by 2030, and more importantly, the per capita disposable income of low-tier cities. Up 84% to US $ 8,261 from 2016 to 2030, a growth rate 56% and 71% higher than that of first-tier and second-tier cities. Even with the average per-capita spending in tier one and tier two cities, the low-tier cities grew 1.2 times to 6,771 US dollar, a second-tier cities grew 82% and 1 times, can show the potential consumption of low-end cities in the future is indeed greater than the first and second tier cities. As low-end urban residents have a higher saving rate, the penetration rate of e-commerce in home users can be raised.
Morgan Stanley Air a good range of consumer stocks from the Chinese brands, the mass media, Hong Kong and Macau, automotive, leisure, aviation, energy and Internet sectors such as ANTA SPORTS PRODUCTS LIMITED (02020), Wanda Cinema (deep: 002739) , Guangzhou Automobile Group Co.,Ltd. (02238), Tencent Holdings Limited (00700) and Alibaba, giving the target price as compared with yesterday's closing price of potential upside from 7% to 59% range, with Guangzhou Automobile and Wanda The highest goal, investors may wish to note. In addition, the bank also mentioned in the other report yesterday that the film industry in the Mainland refers to the over-concentration of market targets on the box office. On the contrary, it overlooks the compound growth of 15% of long-term growth in entertainment consumption, especially in the low-end cities Great potential for consumption, so in addition to watching a good Wanda, but also Diqi IMAX

属化武国际禁用北韩领袖金正恩的同父异母兄长金正男上周一在吉隆坡机场被毒杀，马来西亚初步毒理化验报告显示，金正男是被国际禁用的化学武器VX神经毒剂杀死的。化验人员在死者遗体的眼睛和脸上，都找到这种致命物质的痕
。大马警方表示其中一名被捕的女疑犯也受到毒剂波及而曾经呕吐。警方指当局将为吉隆坡国际机场消毒。大马警方周五上午公布金正男初步验尸解剖结果，指用于谋杀金正男的毒物是无臭无味的VX神经毒剂。警方表示，化学部门自金正男眼睛与脸上採样本化验，结果显示有VX神经毒剂。警察总长哈立德表示，涉嫌以剧毒化武VX杀害金正男的其中一名被捕女疑犯，也受到毒剂波及，随后出现呕吐等不适徵状，但他拒绝说明出现不适的是印尼籍还是越南籍女嫌。哈立德称，警方正追查那些VX毒剂的来源，究竟是在大马製造，抑或从外地带入大马。在谈到是否有人从外地把那些物质带进大马时，他回应道，如果带入境的化学物质数量太少的话，是很难检测到的。哈立德并说：「（我们准备）在所有我们已知嫌犯曾到过的地点展开清洁消毒工作。我们将召集原子能部门专家清查现场，了解是否有放射性物质。」不过，大马原子能局一名官员表示清理化武不是他们的工作，因为VX没有放射性。金正男遇袭时除了到过机场大堂，也到过医疗站和载运他的救护车等地点。女疑犯受波及呕吐警方先前曾表示，两名女袭击者在金正男脸上涂抹一种液体后就走开，并马上洗手，金正男向机场人员求救，但在送院途中死亡。警方已逮捕涉嫌将VX毒剂涂抹于金正男脸上的一名越南女子与一名印尼女子。目前仍不清楚嫌犯当时是否有戴某种薄手套，或是犯桉后迅速洗手以免除毒害。美国佛罗里达大学法医学部门主管、权威毒物学家高德柏格（Bruce
Goldberger）在警方周五发表声明之前表示，如果女嫌没戴手套犯桉，那一定有採取若干保护性措施。高德柏格说：「毒物也有可能先经压缩，抹到皮肤上以后，毒性才活化。」VX是一种比沙林毒性更大的神经毒剂，为最致命的化学武器之一，被列为大杀伤力武器，也是联合国《禁止化学武器公约》禁止使用的化武。专家指出，VX的特性是稳定、容易运送，机场的常规保安检查系统很难侦测得到。大马警方目前拘留三人，包括印尼籍和越南籍女子及一名北韩男子，有四名北韩疑犯据报已逃到平壤。南韩外交部周五发表声明，指使用VX杀害金正男，是「公然违反」国际条约。

","Reuters survey: Japan and the United States may conduct trade talks in the near future Reuters Tokyo April 13 -
Most analysts interviewed by Reuters forecast that Japan will conduct bilateral trade negotiations with the United States in the near future. Next week the two countries will hold high-level economic talks. Japan and the United States will hold an economic dialogue on April 18, with the United States headed by Vice President Burns and the Japanese side led by Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso. Dialogues will cover issues such as macroeconomic policies, infrastructure investment and trade. According to the survey, 16 of the 37 analysts surveyed said they are concerned that the dialogue may hurt Japan. Fifteen analysts said they did not expect the dialogue to yield much, with only a handful of analysts expecting to have a positive impact. Some analysts expect the talks will lay the foundation for future bilateral trade negotiations. ""It is plausible to predict that this Japan-U.S. Economic dialogue will develop into a trade negotiation because the United States believes Japan's unfair trade practices with Midea Group Co.,Ltd. are the result of unfair commercial practices."" TAIWAN TEA CORPORATION China International Capital Corporation Limited Nan Wuzhi, chief research officer at the Institute of Research and Development said. The survey, conducted between April 4 and April 12, said 29 out of 37 analysts said bilateral trade negotiations will be conducted in the near future, while another eight analysts said this is unlikely. U.S. President Trump pulled out of the partnership agreement with The Pacific Securities Co.,Ltd. (TPP) after taking office in January and announced that Washington would seek a one-on-one trade agreement. His protectionist trade policy could hurt the export-oriented economy of Japan. ""Washington may ask Japan to make concessions on matters that have already been agreed in the TPP and the two countries may move into negotiations on specific areas such as cars in order to reduce the U.S. trade deficit."" IHS
Harumi, chief economist at Economics
Taguchi said. A person directly involved in the preparatory work for the talks said on Reuters on Thursday that the United States is actively promoting trade as an important issue in high-level economic talks with Japan. However, Japan is not optimistic about this and tries to avoid turning the talks into a forum where the United States will exert pressure to reduce trade imbalances between the two sides. [nL3T1HL04D] ** Bank of Japan Policy Outlook ** At the same time, most analysts still believe that the Bank of Japan's next move will be to reduce ultra-loose monetary policy. Thirty of the 38 analysts expect the Bank of Japan to phase out its stimulus package while other analysts believe the Bank of Japan could ease further if it changes its policy. This is consistent with the last check results. ""The Bank of Japan has emphasized that it is more important to maintain inflationary momentum than to meet the inflation target of 2% as soon as possible,"" said Hiroshi, chief securities analyst at Shenzhen Capstone Industrial Co.,Ltd.
Ugai said. ""Therefore, we expect the Bank of Japan's next policy action will be to reduce the stimulus, even if the central bank is unable to achieve 2% inflation target in FY 2018."" Some analysts postponed the Bank of Japan's next move expected time. Five analysts believe the central bank will move in the second half of this year, down from 10 in the previous month's survey. Another seven analysts estimate that the time is in the first half of next year, with eight analysts expecting to reach 2018 Will be promoted in the second half. Eleven analysts expect the Bank of Japan to take action in 2019 or later, up from eight in the previous survey. A handful of analysts are reluctant to anticipate the timing of the policy. Asked about the Bank of Japan's decision to withdraw its stimulus package, most analysts expected the central bank to raise the 10-year bond yield target from the current 0%. Other analysts said the central bank will raise the excess reserve rate for commercial banks at the central bank from a negative 0.1%. Analysts predict Japan's economy will grow by 1.3% in the fiscal year starting in April and 1.1% in the second fiscal year. This is respectively 1.2% and 1.0% higher than the previous estimate of last month. Japan's core consumer prices, which contain oil but exclude fresh food, are expected to rise 0.8% in the fiscal year and 1.0% in the second fiscal year, roughly in line with the March survey.

gate（厕纸门事件），那麽她追贴鬍鬚曾甚至来个民望逆转反胜，完全是有可能的。当然，不懂得如何使用八达通入闸搭地铁的场面切忌再重演，正所谓「民生无小事」，要是堂堂特首潜在人选居然对于民生事项一窍不通，试问谁够胆相信此人有本事急民之所急？还有一点必须格外注意，过往的ABC口号原本针对梁振英（Anyone
But CY），如今的ABC炮口则改作针对林郑（Anyone But
Carrie），归根究柢是恐怕未来特首延续梁振英路线。林郑近日不断否认自己是梁振英2.0，强调不会「屁股指挥脑袋」，诚属聪明之举，但仍然要加把劲，才可摆脱ABC魔咒，奶妈别低估坊间这几年积压的怨气。

","Lin Cheng changed ""good chase"" Since it is known as the running mares game, the winning course is of course the power and the fight, the so-called hurdles, the first election by the Chief Executive can have the last laugh, and not necessarily win The starting line of the gate, the key is who crossed the finish line first. Although there are still two months to formally vote on March 26, from the current analysis of the fighting situation, Mrs Carrie Lam is indeed a quality horse with ""food power"". Although she started late, she was able to catch up from behind. However, No one would dare to say that there is not much opportunity as long as it is not like the ""Chief Executive"" Andy Lau has unfortunately not fallen to horse house or the government house where there is no shortage of toilet paper. According to the latest opinion poll commissioned by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the newspaper asked: ""The following five people have been either quoted or declared to be candidates for election to the office of the chief executive. You are most supportive of the election of a chief executive."" The interviewees remained most beloved of the beard, Mr Tsang Chun-wah. He was among the best at 33.5% and beat Mrs Carrie LAU by 30.9% only followed by 8.1% of HU Kwok-hing, with 6.4% It is even worse than the 7.2% former Legislative Council Chairman Tsang Yok-sing who has not yet said exactly what to run for. Question conversion, if the final competition by the two former chiefs, Mr Tsang's support rate was 48.7%, Mrs Carrie is 39.9%. Undoubtedly, beards have continued to have the advantage of leading democrats but two points of caution. First, when asked how many respondents in reality predict who wins, 63.5% answered Lin Cheng and only 17.4% answered Ceng Junhua. The second point is more intriguing. Compared with the opinion poll conducted at the end of October last year (when CY chiefs showed no signs of no reelection), there was a mere 10.3% support rate at that time, well behind the 28.4% beard Zeng. Elections, her popularity suddenly climbed to 30.9%, the margin of backwardness narrowed to 2.6 percentage points only. In other words, when Lam was changed from ""Beat"" to ""Chase,"" he flew back and forth to catch up to Jitou. Once again proves that people like this thing and really like the clouds, can rise or fall, can be floated, instant glory, of course, does not mean eternal, a hundred years of loneliness is also not a bad fish reincarnation. Although Hengtong Optic-Electric CO.,LTD and its political affair are not necessarily related to Kung Fu, there have been many successful examples of Wei Xiaobao's death in ancient times. The U.S. President Trump has just debuted Recent model. This time, it is not difficult for the SAR official wet nurse to play this game to attract ordinary people to join the ""Milk Powder Club"" with the image of ""Good Play"". Instead, she needs to show her how invincible she is, or suddenly unnaturally creating a cordiality. Cautiously, no longer out of the ""convenience store can not buy toilet paper"" and the like funny jokes, even foreign media also jokingly called Loo
paper-
gate (toilet paper door incident), then she chase beard had even come to a popular reversal of victory, it is entirely possible. Of course, do not know how to use the Octopus gate to take the subway scene should not be repeated, the so-called ""people's livelihood is no small thing,"" if the potential candidates for dignitaries actually ignorant of people's livelihood matters, who would have enough courage to believe that this person has the urgency of emergency ? It is also important to note that the old ABC slogan was originally for Anyone
But CY), today's ABC muzzle is changed for Anyeng Butter (Anyone But
Carrie), in the final analysis I am afraid that the future chief executive continued Liang Zhenying line. Recently, Lin Cheng has repeatedly denied that he is Leung Chun-ying 2.0. He stressed that it would not be ""ass to head his head"". It is a smart move, but he still has to work harder to get rid of the ABC curse. The nurse should not underestimate the backlog of grievances in recent years.",林郑变了「好追得」,Not Reuters,08:29AM 19 Jan 2017,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I1a184ce0e33911e6a512e6ce71c174f2.1C.html

民间投资优于预期，带动台湾第一季GDP超预期成长，且为连续第四季正增长。分析人士认为，台湾今年经济成长率越过2%的机率看增，惟民间消费不佳值得观察。台湾主计总处周五公布，第一季国内生产总值(GDP)概估值为年成长2.56%，高于路透调查预估中值2.45%，但仍较去年第四季的2.88%略走弱；第一季经季调对上折成年率(SAAR)的经济成长率为2.93%，经季调对上季的经济成长率(SAQR)为0.72%。主计总处专门委员黄伟杰指出，Global
Insight机构近期将全球经济成长率调升0.1个百分点，包括主要各国如日本、欧洲和美国等主计国家经济成长陆续被调高，若是台湾政府下半年的前瞻基础建设能够顺利在立法院通过、施行，应能够乐观看待今年的成长率。〞第一季(经济成长率)比之前预估的多0.11个百分点，主要是民间投资优于预期。〞他表示。主计总处资料并未揭露民间投资数字，但公布了资本形成数据，资本形成包括政府、公营与民间固定投资及存货变动。新闻稿指出，今年首季半导体业者扩充先进製程投资，航空业者扩充机队，台币计价的资本设备进口大增等原因，使首季资本形成实质成长8.10%，较2月预估时成长7.11%为佳。〞今年台湾经济成长率达到2%水准的机会渐增，至于央行第二季利率决策则料维持不变，暂先观察美联储升息步调，最快可能9月才会升息，〞国泰金控经济研究处协理陈钦奇称。他认为，今年上半年台湾经济能见度较高，预期上半年表现比下半年来得好。台湾行政院先前宣布将在未来八年投资8,824亿台币〞前瞻础建设〞的财政刺激政策，但自估对经济成长贡献的乘数效果很低，分析师的估计也偏保守；工商界产业则认为，政府振兴经济提高长期竞争力很好，但别忽略採行短期策略。[nL3T1GZ2MM]台湾央行今年3月间宣布重贴现率维持在1.375%不变，是连续三季维持利率不变。**民间消费不佳值得观察**至于民间消费方面，主计总处表示，第一季的整体零售营业额负成长0.64%，是2015年第三季以来首见负成长。而虽然首季的股票成交值年增8.62%，但民间消费仅成长1.62%，却较2月间的预估成长1.68%为低。对此，黄伟杰指出，零售营业数字受到外国观光客来台消费不如预期的影响出现负成长。至于民间消费是扣除外人来台消费，却也表现平疲，动能不佳，估计实质薪资增幅不高、少子化及房贷压力大等，都可能是原因之一。元大投顾首席经济学家陈森林认为，展望未来，全年GDP估在2%左右，由于今年经济增长动能温和，全年CPI也仅估在1.1%，因此要见到央行升息机率不高。外需方面，主计总处表示，服务贸易受三角贸易毛利转佳和来台旅客续减的影响，若剔除物价因素，商品和服务输出实质成长6.99%。(完)(记者

","Update 1 - Taiwan data: Good private investment led the first quarter GDP over-expected growth, the annual growth rate of more than 2% chance to see the increase (add analyst comments and details) Reuters Taipei April 28 -
Better-than-expected private investment led Taiwan's first-quarter GDP to exceed-expected growth, and for the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Analysts believe that the chance of Taiwan's economic growth rate exceeding 2% this year is expected to increase, but poor private consumption is worth observing. Taiwan's chief planning office said on Friday that gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter was estimated at an annualized 2.56%, up 2.45% from the Reuters survey but still slightly below the 2.88% for the fourth quarter of last year Weakening. The economy grew by 2.93% quarter-over-quarter (SAAR) in the first quarter and 0.72% quarter-on-quarter (SAQR). Chief Accountant Huang Weijie pointed out that
Insight recently raised its global economic growth rate by 0.1 percentage point. Economic growth in major countries such as Japan, Europe and the United States has been gradually raised. If the forward-looking infrastructure in the second half of Taiwan's government can be successfully approved by the Legislative Yuan, , Should be optimistic about this year's growth rate. ""The first quarter (economic growth rate) was 0.11 percentage points higher than previously estimated, mainly due to better-than-expected private investment,"" he said. CPG data did not reveal the figures for private investment, but released the capital formation data. Capital formation included government, public and private fixed investment and changes in inventories. The press release pointed out that in the first quarter of this year, the semiconductor industry expanded its investment in advanced process investments, expanding the fleet of aircraft carriers and greatly boosted the import of capital equipment priced in the Taiwan Strait. As a result, the capital growth in the first quarter increased substantially by 8.10% from the previous estimate of 7.11% Better. ""Taiwan's economic growth this year, the chance to reach 2% level of growth, as the central bank's second-quarter interest rate decision is expected to remain unchanged, the first observation of the Fed rate hike, the earliest possible rate hike in September,"" Cathay Pacific Airways Limited Mega Financial Holding Company Ltd. Economic Research Branch Associate Chen Qinqi said. In his opinion, the economic visibility of Taiwan in the first half of this year is high, and the performance in the first half of the year is expected to be better than that in the second half of the year. Taiwan's Executive Yuan earlier announced that it will invest a total of 882.4 billion Taiwan dollars in the next eight years, ""forward-looking construction"" of the fiscal stimulus, but since the estimated contribution to the economic growth of the multiplier effect is very low, analysts estimate partiality conservative; business industry They think that it is good for the government to revitalize its economy and enhance its long-term competitiveness. However, it is important not to neglect to adopt a short-term strategy. [nL3T1GZ2MM] Taiwan's central bank announced in March this year, the heavy discount rate remained unchanged at 1.375%, is to maintain interest rates unchanged for the third consecutive quarters. ** Non-government spending is worth watching * As for private consumption, the HKPC said the overall retail sales in the first quarter showed a negative growth of 0.64%, the first negative growth since the third quarter of 2015. Although the transaction value of stocks in the first quarter increased by 8.62% year-on-year, private consumption grew only 1.62%, but it was lower than the 1.68% forecast for February. In response, Mr Wong pointed out that the retail sales figures were negatively affected by the unexpected impact of spending by foreign tourists visiting Taiwan. As for private consumption, excluding outsiders spending in Taiwan, they also show signs of flattening and poor kinetic energy. It is estimated that the real wage increase is not high, and the downsizing and mortgage pressures are all likely to be one of the reasons. Chen Senlin, chief economist at Yuanta Financial Holdings Co.,Ltd, said that looking forward to the future, the annual GDP is estimated to be around 2%. Due to the modest economic growth this year, the annual CPI will only be estimated at 1.1%. Therefore, we should see The central bank to raise interest rates is not high. On the external demand side, the head office said the trade in services was better off by TRIANGLE TIRE CO.,LTD's trade margin and the continued drop in visitors to Taiwan. Excluding the price factor, the output of goods and services increased by 6.99% in real terms. (End) (Reporter

I1b01a04009ed11e7aba0cc5eded9a1a7.1C,"辩论是英语特色文化香港特首选举电视辩论是一种四不像的溷杂产品：香港没有民主普选，电视机前的观众没有投票权；辩论从来都不是香港文化，辩论的结果也与特首谁属毫无关係。首先是限时发言的规则十分可笑，特首选举辩论不是辩论比赛，只会令观众在潜意识中将特首候选人与中学辩论队选手联繫挂u，导致候选人形象的「矮化」。本来滔滔不绝横遭打断，破坏现场气氛和发言人的思维脉络，对候选人十分不公，即使生来有口若悬河之才，出口成文，也没有发挥的空间。演讲辩论讲究的是气势，一鼓作气，再而衰，三而竭，被打断得多，发言的人无瘾，观众也会转台。辩论的性质本来与戏剧相通，辩论要像一台戏那样精采，全无冷场，唇枪舌剑也像拳来脚往那样虎虎生风，否则有甚麽好辩论？中国文化本来不完全排斥口才，春秋战国时代的游士说客，也要凭口才和见识去说服诸侯；诸葛亮出使东吴，可以一个人单挑全场，舌战群儒。但是帝王统治愈极权，只要一言堂，愈来愈容不下辩论，道光皇帝的一个宰相曹振镛说，官运亨通的秘诀，无非是多磕头，少说话而已。真正的辩论，不仅只限民主社会，甚至有可能是英国特有的文化，难以为其他文化模彷，即使传播到美国、加拿大、澳洲，辩论的水准也大打折扣。英国的议会辩论一直富有戏剧感，尤其是每周三的首相答问，网络收视也人气十足，因为英国的议会辩论不但议员要比试口齿伶俐，才思敏捷，首相上阵更要有舞台主角的风范，面对两边议员的叫好或者喝倒采，必须显出胸有成竹，气定乾坤。首相见招拆招，由自己的党员拱护，反对党率众极尽嘲笑之能，全场经常笑声雷动，因为这是一个舞台。实际执政运作并不需要辩才，也与辩论的结果无关，辩论的舞台是给政客展示自己的抱负和视野、逻辑思维及个人趣味，如果没有内涵呼应，所谓「口才」无非是牙尖嘴利而已。所谓内涵，不一定要真善美，也不必学富五车，但必须成一家之言，对于时势命运有自己的独到看法，而不是一味背诵政纲。好像美国总统特朗普，此人演讲也甚有魅力，不是因为像邱吉尔那样饱学，也不是像列根那样有幽默感，而是誓愿为个人信念一战，相信要有人站出来维护美国的本土价值，要美国人优先，而他就是这头捍屿国的勐虎，当仁不让之选。个人信念在当今的政客中十分罕有，这二十年来，西方民选政客流行夸夸其谈，形象讨好的一种风格，最典型的莫过于特朗普的前任奥巴马，但奥巴马这种政客关注的，到底是留下一个甚麽美国，还是留下一个甚麽个人名声？答桉显而易见。戴卓尔夫人卸任之际，一度当场挥泪，但是她说，欣慰的是她离开时英国的状况，比她刚接手的时候好得多，这才是政治家的境界。

","Debate is the culture of English characteristic Hong Kong Chief Executive Election The television debate is a fickle miscellaneous product: Hong Kong has no universal suffrage for democracy and the audience in front of the TV station does not have the right to vote. The debate has never been Hong Kong's culture. The debate has nothing to do with it system. The first is that the rule of limited time speaking is very ridiculous. The Chief Electoral Debate is not a debate. It only causes the audience to subconsciously contact the candidates of the chief debate with the contestants of the secondary debate team, resulting in the ""dwarfing"" of the candidate's image. Originally, it was interrupted incessantly, ruining the mood of the scene and the spokesman's thinking, which was very unfair to the candidates. Even if it was born eloquent and exported, there was no room for its exportation. Speeches focused on the momentum debate, boasted, and then decline, three exhausted, was much more interrupted, speechless people addiction, the audience will be transferred to Taiwan. The nature of the debate has always been the same with the drama, the debate should be as brilliant as a drama, no cold market, like a fist, like a fist to the tiger, otherwise there is a good debate? Chinese culture did not completely exclude eloquence. In the era of the Spring and Autumn Period, the warriors and lobbyists of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period also persuaded their princes with their eloquence and knowledge. Zhuge Liang came to Soochow to lead the audience and fight against Confucianism. However, as the monarchs rule more and more, as long as a word of speech grows more tolerant of the debate, Cao Zhenlian, a prime minister of the Emperor Daoguang, said that the secret of official operation is nothing more than kowtowing and less talking. The real debate is not limited to a democratic society. It may even be a culture unique to the United Kingdom. It is difficult to imitate other cultures. Even if it is spread to the United States, Canada and Australia, the debate will be greatly reduced. Britain's parliamentary debate has always had a sense of drama. In particular, every Wednesday's Prime Minister's question and answer are also popular online. As the British parliamentary debate is not only clever and clever, the premier must have a stage hero in his argument. Applauded or underemployed on both sides of the legislature, we must show that you have a well-thought-spirited, atmosphere set heaven and earth. The Prime Minister met with his own party and his party members. The opposition party laughed at the ridicule and the audience often laughed loudly because it was a stage. The actual governing operation does not require debate or debate. The stage of the debate is to show politicians their own ambitions and visions, logical thinking and personal interests. Without echoes, the so-called ""eloquence"" is nothing more than a sharp tip . The so-called connotation, not necessarily the truth, the good, do not have to learn five rich cars, but must be made into one of the words, have their own unique view of the current situation and destiny, rather than blindly recite platform. Like President Trump, the speech of this person is also very attractive. It is not because he is full of learning like Churchill. Nor is he having a sense of humor like Leagan. He vowed to fight for personal conviction and believed that someone should stand up and defend the homeland of the United States Value, to the Americans priority, and he is the first to defend the country Meng tiger, doing my part to choose. Personal beliefs are very rare among today's politicians. In the past two decades, the style of popular Western politicians exaggerating their popularity is the most typical one. Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, is the most popular type of politician. However, what the concern of Obama politicians is What the United States left, or leave a personal reputation? Eucalyptus is obvious. Mrs Tehrad, who was on her way to the ground when she stepped down, said with dedication, but she said that she was relieved that the situation in England when she left was much better than she had just taken over. That was the realm of politicians.",辩论是英语特色文化,Not Reuters,02:01PM 20 Dec 2017,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I1b01a04009ed11e7aba0cc5eded9a1a7.1C.html

Louis、Fendi、Versace、Miele、Gaggenau等皇室御用或百年品牌在屋内随处可见，堆砌出心目中的宫廷之家。设计师又指：「户主是海外华侨，年中不时回港探望亲友，因此看中交通方便、能由机场直达的屋苑，当作一家人的度假屋。」视觉的飨宴相比金碧辉煌，设计师自玄关起就採用黑白灰啡的基调，再缀以玫瑰金，不落俗套。要加添变化设计师便利用来自意大利的Carrara云石铺饰牆壁、地板，配合镜钢、皮革、木材，质感丰富。设计师补充道：「厨房、厕所、鞋柜採用暗门、趟门隐藏，融入曲尺型走廊的特色牆。走廊与大厅以一道云石拱门区分，空间更富层次感。」进入厅堂，可发现全屋甚少运用油漆，而且就连天花也缀以双重玫瑰金不锈钢框线，加上对比鲜明的黑啡云石电视牆及地板，尽显奢华之馀，空间感更深邃。设计师又故意在客饭厅以至楼梯间挂上大型吊灯，营造目不暇给的视觉效果外，更有助渲染大屋格调。基于大部分结构牆都不能改动，以及屋主要求保留下层3房间隔，所以下层布局改动不大。平时屋主住在20000方呎大宅，相对这单位在空间感方面不能相提并论。考虑到度假屋毋须太多储物空间，设计师乾脆减少睡房的柜组，腾出地方摆放大床，同时不怕显得过于狭窄。配合床头灰色条子扪皮、钢材线条，有效拉高楼底。微调大不同虽说因面积限制，空间感难以做到皇室宫廷的效果，但因上层只得主人房及平台花园，只要微调间隔，效果就已大大不同。设计师接着说：「主人房的原则衣帽间及浴室位置对调，因为衣帽间尽是柜组，窗户并非必要。现在于浴室里便可一边享受按摩浴，一边欣赏窗外的景色。」细心的他又于衣帽间与睡床之间加设Mini
Bar，户主想小酌几杯时就毋须特意走到楼下。主人房以深啡色为主调，配上利落的玫瑰金不锈钢线条，勾勒出优雅高贵的气息，贯彻全屋风格。床头的Hermès扪皮一直延伸至天花板，一气呵成。设计师又表示：「屋主希望平时不会见到电视机，所以我们利用电子趟门或升降装置将它们隐藏起来。而且全屋无论是花园或室内的冷气、灯光、音响、窗帘、地热装置都以智能家居系统操作，非常方便。」离开主人房去到另一边的平台花园，设计师将地台增高，本来被米六高围牆阻碍的视野顿时豁然开朗，感觉更舒适写意。设有烧烤炉、閒座区、按摩浴缸、太阳伞的花园加上迷人的维港景致，彷彿置身于度假胜地。

In the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, the Eucalyptus head of the specially selected skyscrapers top duplex units, and then invited the designer Eric (Fung Kin Yiu) surgeon, to create both a royal style, but also modern flavor gorgeous House. Indifferent to simple style of homeowners love the noble and elegant royal style, so they and designers at the cost of work, direct flights to Italy, France, select the latest high-end furniture. Saint
Louis, Fendi, Versace, Miele, Gaggenau, such as the Royal Queen or a hundred years in the house can be seen everywhere, piled up in the eyes of the court home. The designer also said: ""The head of the household is an overseas Chinese who returns to Hong Kong from time to time to visit his relatives and friends. Therefore, seeing the traffic convenient and being able to travel directly from the airport as a family vacation home."" Compared with the resplendent, Designer since the entrance on the use of black and white gray tone tone, then decorated with rose gold, unconventional. To add to change designers will use Carrara marble from Italy to decorate the walls, floor, mirror steel, leather, wood, rich in texture. The designer added: ""The kitchen, toilet and shoe closet are concealed and merged into the curved walls of the curved corridor, separated by a marble archway, giving a sense of space."" Entering the auditorium can be found Little paint is used throughout the house, and even ceilings are framed by double rose gold stainless steel framing, with contrasting black-brown marble wall and floor to create a sense of extravagant space. Designers also purposely hang large chandeliers in guest dining rooms and staircases to create superb visual effects, but also help to render the style of big houses. Based on most of the structural wall can not be changed, and the owner asked to keep the lower 3 rooms separated, so the layout of the lower floor changed little. Homeowners usually live in 20,000 square feet mansion, relative to the unit in the sense of space can not be compared. Taking into account the holiday homes do not need too much storage space, designers simply reduce the bedroom cabinet units, freeing places placed big bed, while not afraid to appear too narrow. With the bed of gray strips palpable leather, steel lines, effectively pulling the floor. Although the fine tuning of the area due to restrictions, the sense of space is difficult to achieve the royal court's effect, but only the master room and the upper platform garden, as long as the fine-tuning interval, the effect has been greatly different. The designer went on to say: ""The principle of the master room The cloakroom and the bathroom are in tune with each other because the cloakroom is full of cabinets and the windows are not necessary. Now you can enjoy the jacuzzi in the bathroom while enjoying the view out of the window. Add a Mini between the cloakroom and the bed
Bar, head of the family want to drink a few cups when not going downstairs. The main room to dark brown-based tone, coupled with neat rose gold stainless steel lines, outlines the elegant atmosphere, the implementation of the whole house style. The bed Hermès palpitations has been extended to the ceiling, at one go. The designer also said: ""The owners hope they will not see the TV in the normal time so we hide them with the electronic sliding door or the lifting device. And the whole house, whether it is garden or indoor air-conditioning, lighting, sound, curtains, With smart home system operation, very convenient. ""To leave the master room to go to the other side of the platform garden, designers will increase the platform, Miyagi had been blocking the horizons suddenly suddenly, I feel more comfortable and freehand.

Trump inaugural address does not emphasize policy details NEW YORK, January 20 - The dollar is trading lower Friday amid turbulent trading as investors failed to find any support for the dollar under the inaugural address of the new president, Trump
The reason for big betting. The dollar index dropped to its intraday low during Trump's speech as Trump promised ""U.S. priority"" in his speech, triggering some
Concerns about trade protectionist policies. However, the decline was weak as Trump did not talk about specific economic and trade policies. ""There does not seem to be anything that drives the market,"" TJM said

We see the dollar consolidating some of the recent gains similar to ... the consolidation that the Federal Reserve emerged early in the year after the Fed raised interest rates in 2015.

For the first time in 10 years. The dollar fell against the euro, the yen and the pound, with a slight gain recorded earlier in the day. The dollar rose against the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar and the Canadian dollar, as well as currencies of most other major commodity producers. Uncertainty in the market caused the US dollar to fluctuate within a narrow range, after the U.S. dollar fluctuated sharply the previous week due to the uncertainties surrounding Trump's governance of the country

下跌股份逾400隻；整体1900多隻港股的升跌比例为66︰34。市宽表现方面，3天线高于18天线、股价高于50天线及股价高于250天线比率分别为54.7%（跌0.6个百分点）、47%（升4.3个百分点）及53.8%（升1.9个百分点）。
❷板块分析25个板块中有多达24个板块录得上升，升幅介乎0.21%至2.17%，惟当中只有8个板块表现跑赢恒指。物流运输是昨天表现最佳板块。内地媒体引述知情人士透露，中远海运集团、达飞轮船、长荣海运将参与东方海外的收购战，中远海运中标的可能性较大。受消息刺激，东方海外国际（00316）一度急升逾一成，收市升7.3%。其他航运股亦炒上，中远海控（01919）飙6.9%，中远海发（02866）、中远海能（01138）、太平洋航运（02343）均涨逾3%。
❸沽空/澹仓港股全日沽空金额68.24亿元，另有约114.6万元人民币沽空，大市沽空比率9.97%，较上日上升约1.5个百分点。个股方面，盈富基金（02800）全日沽空金额居首，金额6.36亿元，沽空比率30.1%。第二及第三位分别是建设银行（00939）及友邦保险（01299），沽空金额（和比率）为3.68亿元（19.6%）和3.53亿元（20.3%）。
❹个股短评恒生（00011）明显突破水平阻力，表现稍赢恒指，料有机会挑战162元高位。参考EJFQ.com
FA+资料，综合12位分析员预测，其2016年及2017年的每股盈利按年增长分别为负40.1%及8.3%，预测巿账率为1.9倍，估值偏贵。
❺衍生市场表现从周二收市后数据看，最新牛熊证街货比例为48：52，比例相对接近，惟近价熊证数目明显较多。「恒指牛熊证窝轮最痛指标」最低点范围在22000至23500点，最低点为23100点。恒指窝轮录得160万元资金淨流出，恒指牛熊证更录得2828万元资金淨流出；整体资金淨流出反映散户倾向澹仓部署。
❻A股表现内地股市个别发展，上证指数连升两日，企稳3100点，深成指则反覆向下。上证指数窄幅上落，全日收报3113点，升4点（0.14%），成交1445亿元（人民币．下同）。深成指低开，午后曾一度倒升，惟收市跌22点（0.22%），收报9804点，成交1721亿元。两市成交再缩减12%，至3167亿元。有分析指出，投资者入市意欲不强，中小型股回复疲弱；临近新春长假，投资者观望情绪逐渐浓厚，料后市以低位整固为主。
❼异动股周三10隻异动股中，有6隻股份股价上升，当中一隻录得双位数字的升幅。下跌股份之一的李宁（02331）昨天录得两笔共1.14亿股市前成交，每股作价4.76元，较周二收市价折让3.6%，涉资约5.43亿元。据外电指出，李宁遭主要股东私募基金TPG减持1.14亿股，佔已发行股本约5.7%。李宁全日收报4.87元，跌0.07元（1.4%），成交金额7.4亿元。
❽市场观点美国三藩市联储银行总裁威廉斯认为，联储局逐步加息，是确保美国经济持续增长的重要因素，以及确保不会出现通胀过高及资产泡沫情况。他指出，要确保全民就业与通胀接近2%指标的经济持续强势，
逐步加息是合宜的。无论是美国本土或是其他国家，现时受很多不明朗因素困扰，而不是只限于扩张财政政策问题，但整体风险仍属可控。

I1c6852d0d45011e69bcda2dc249ca57e.1C,"美债息升势急
港股小注出击2016年美国经济明显转好，劳动市场持续有改善，通胀预期在特朗普当选美国总统后显着升温，美国联储局顺势于上月宣布10年来第二次加息。该局在12月货币政策声明中更透出鹰派的口风，暗示今年加息次数可能达到3次，超出市场的普遍预测。展望2017年，美国加息步伐、法国总统大选、德国国会选举以及英国正式启动脱欧程序均成为全球焦点。政治事件或会导致金融市场波澜起伏，但回顾去年两次「黑天鹅」来袭仅造成短暂震盪，故相信在美国加息周期中，美元持续强势和债市走弱，才是今年的投资主调。环球债息早于去年第四季出现转捩点，开始呈现上调压力。以美国30年期国债息率为例，去年11月起升势明显加快，且突破了于2013年尾形成的下降轨道；随时有机会挑战2015年约3.25厘的高位【图】。与此同时，美国10年期国债息率同样飙升，美国大选后一度连涨6周，升至逾2.6厘近年高位。目前，息率虽然回落至不足2.4厘水平，但值得注意的是，联储局上月议息会议纪录显示，委员普遍认为特朗普的财政政策有机会刺激经济，迫使加息步伐提速，以遏抑通胀。若情况属实，国债息率上涨之势或会持续。投资者应注意美国10年期国债孳息率会否升穿约3厘水平的关键阻力位，因为从技术走势角度看，此乃自上世纪八十年代中开始的下降通道顶线，亦相当于2013年的徘徊区高位，故长债息率突破此重要阻力后，或代表运行逾30年的美债大牛市终结。国债息率上升不单止利澹债券价格，对其他资产类别的价值也会造成下行压力。从基本面看，风险资产的估值是以国债收益率（代表无风险收益率）作为计算基础，所以该利率一旦上扬，以此作为折现率的资产价格即会有下调的风险。纵然投资者应该对长债息率上行所引申的资产价格调整提高警惕，惟市场仍不时有出现短炒的机会。本栏早前提及若港股3天线高于18天线比率（短线市宽）徘徊于支持区内，大市有较大可能出现整固；元旦假期后，港股开局不俗，恒指企稳于22000点以上水平，更升穿50天线，全周累涨逾500点，收报22503点。短线市宽于今轮反弹已升穿强弱分界线附近，表示「市底」明显改善。然而，恒指今次升浪能走多远，还看该比率可以持续上涨到哪个水平。另一边厢，信报EJFQ系统的恒指综合指数日线轮动图（无基准）显示，科技板块的相对动力和相对表现在过去一周均大幅提高，当中有多隻股份正在转强，包括ASM太平洋（00522）及伟易达（00303），投资者可以考虑一博。不过，就周线轮动图可见，大市仍处于中长线的跌势，所以投资者暂不宜过分进取，以免承受太大风险。

In December, the council made a hawkish tone in its monetary policy statement in December, hoping the rate hike this year could reach 3 times, exceeding market consensus. Looking forward to 2017, the pace of U.S. rate hikes, the French presidential election, the German parliamentary election and the UK formally embarking on the process of Brexit have all become global focuses. Political events may lead to turmoil in financial markets. However, recalling that the ""Black Swan"" raids caused only a brief turmoil last year, it is believed that the U.S. dollar will continue to be strong and the bond market will weaken during the U.S. rate hike cycle. This is the year for investors Tune Global debt as early as the fourth quarter of last year, turning point, began to show upward pressure. Taking the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond interest rate as an example, the upward trend accelerated markedly since November last year and exceeded the downward trajectory that was formed at the end of 2013. At any time, we have the opportunity to challenge the 2015 high of around 3.25%. In the meantime, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate soared as well. For the sixth consecutive week, the U.S. election rose to more than 2.6% in recent years. At present, although the interest rate dropped to less than 2.4%, it is noteworthy that the record of the Federal Reserve meeting last month showed that members generally agreed that Trump's fiscal policy has the opportunity to stimulate the economy and force the rate hike to speed up to contain Inflation. If the situation is true, the trend of rising bond yields may continue. Investors should be aware of whether the yield on the 10-year U.S. government bond will rise above the key resistance at about 3%. This is because from the technical point of view, it is the top of the downward spiral that has started since the mid-1980s. At the high of the HSI in 2013, after the long-term debt ratio broke through this important resistance, or on behalf of the major U.S. bull market running for over 30 years, it ended. The rise in the interest rate of treasury bonds not only yields the price of bonds but also puts downward pressure on the value of other asset classes. Fundamentally, the valuation of risky assets is based on the calculation of the yield on government bonds (representing the risk-free rate of return), so once the interest rate rises, the risk of a downward adjustment will be the asset price that is used as the discount rate. Even though investors should be wary of the asset price adjustment arising from the long-term interest rate upward move, the market may still have occasional short-term speculation. As mentioned earlier in this column, if the ratio of 3 antennas above 18 in Hong Kong stocks (short-term market wide) hovers in the support zone, the broader market is likely to consolidate. After the New Year holidays, the Hong Kong market started well and the HSI stabilized at above 22,000 points Level, up more wear 50 antenna throughout the week soared more than 500 points to close at 22,503 points. The short-term market widening above the current round of rally has risen above the strength boundary, indicating that ""the market bottom"" has improved significantly. However, how far the HSI can go this time and how long it will continue to rise. On the other hand, the HSI Daily Index (without benchmark) for the HSI by EJFQ system shows that the relative momentum and relative performance of the technology sector have both risen sharply in the past week. Among them, only a few stocks have been strengthened, including ASM The Pacific Securities Co.,Ltd. (00522) and VTECH HOLDINGS LIMITED (00303), investors can consider a Bo. However, as can be seen from the weekly rotation chart, the market is still in the long-term decline, so investors should not be aggressive for the time being so as not to bear too much risk.",美债息升势急 港股小注出击,Not Reuters,04:28PM 22 Jul 2017,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I1c6852d0d45011e69bcda2dc249ca57e.1C.html

","More than 10 billion yuan investment in joint venture risk Kam on the road station received eight standard
China-Hong Kong consortium competed last week, the Central Merit Road commercial land king to grant a sky-high price, the other market attracted attention West Rail Kam Sheung Road Station Phase 1 residential project also cut-off yesterday, immediately attracted eight consortium bid competition, the number of tender In line with the market expectation, and mainly local large developers, the recent frequent high land grabbing the Chinese are slightly ""tolerant""; due to the project development scale, involving more than 10 billion yuan of investment, some consortia ""alliance"" to a joint venture In the form of competitive bidding, we can see that the competition is fierce. The railway superstructure project is the land supply base for this year. The first one is the first phase of the West Rail Kam On Road Station. The site is located on the southwest of Kam Sheung Road Station and was originally a parking lot. The area is rectangular in shape and is quite easy to cut. The scale of development is quite substantial, helping to reduce development costs per square foot and is attractive to large developers. The project cut-off yesterday, MTR spokesman announced a total of eight bids received. The developers bidding for the project are mainly large-scale developers in Hong Kong. The project, originally scheduled to be closed on Wednesday, has been the first to be acquired by Cheung Kong and the consortium of Chinatown Empire Group, but the project is delayed by a day of black rains Truncated to yesterday. The two Chinese-funded financial institutions to participate in the site yesterday, the founding consortium including SUN HUNG KAI PROPERTIES LIMITED, 痚 礡 B New World and The Wharf (Holdings) Limited and so on. In addition, CHINA RESOURCES LAND LIMITED also entered the tender. As a result, a number of consortia also formed ""alliances"" in the form of joint ventures to enhance their strength, including Sino-Fi joint venture with China Overseas JV. In fact, SUN HUNG KAI PROPERTIES LIMITED has successively voted for more plots of land adjacent to Yuen Long and Tin Shui Wai in recent years. It is anticipated by the insiders that the Group will further expand its territory in the northwestern New Territories after winning the project. Therefore, Not bad. The Wharf (Holdings) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Wharf (Holdings) Limited, said on behalf of the group's successful WHEELOCK AND COMPANY LIMITED real estate manager Stephen Ho said the group favorite project near the MTR station, convenient transportation, the bid will take into account all aspects of the material property market stable. Part of the bidding progress It is learned that the project will continue to use the recent ""one-price"" model to determine the winner, that is, the consortia will need to make their own decisions and pay the sum of money to MTR. Some major developers have revealed that the railway superstructure projects have always been much favored by the market. Therefore, the contention of this project can be quite fierce. Some consortia have over 8.5 billion yuan in the project price, which is equivalent to more than 7,000 yuan per square foot Yuan, bid quite aggressive. Lam Hau-wen, Knight Frank's senior director and head of valuation and consultancy, said that although there are currently no supporting facilities in the area, the limited supply of large-scale residential developments in MTR stations has always been present. Coupled with the fact that the project is located on a mature railway line, In recent years, the new site in Yuen Long is selling well. If there is a developer of existing projects in the district, the offer will be more aggressive. I believe that a few days ago, the tight control of the HKMA had little effect on the developers' bidding. Five thousand five hundred to six thousand five hundred dollars, equivalent to a valuation of about 6.8 billion to eight billion yuan. Can build 1652 gang
Estimated at more than 6.8 billion Ideal City Group, Zhang Shengdian, head of the corporate valuation department said that as the total investment of more than 10 billion yuan, the number of successful targets is expected, the current lack of supporting measures near the project must meet the development of the second phase is sufficient since Into a country, it is necessary to include his bidding potential for development, bluntly rate is very high, expected after the completion of the project floor price per square foot more than 15,000 yuan. According to the information, there are limited-fee provisions for the project. Developers are required to construct not less than 1,652 units, of which at least 40% (ie a minimum of 66) should be built up to an area of ​​not more than 538 Square feet. According to insiders, as many developers prefer to build small and medium-size flats, the relevant provisions will not have much impact on the winning consortium. Kai Tak Commercial Targets Today In addition, Kai Tak 1F Area 2 commercial / hotel site today closed. The site is about 250,000 square feet and can be built over 1.9 million square feet. The industry point out that the land can be used for the comprehensive development of building, hotel and retail, and is adjacent to the future sand

《神州纵横》粤港澳大湾区自纳入两会政府工作报告而成为国家区域协作的重点项目后，广东省属下的区内九市均已出台新的发展规划积极参与建设，掀开了新一轮发展热潮。这不单可为全省增长提供新动力，还可令广东的发展水平在几年内再上层楼。＊掀起新投资开发热潮＊
大湾区首先要做好内外交通连接。在这方面计划中、在建及已有的网络堪称完备。区内将以广州深圳为综合枢纽，合共布置１０条高铁１０条普铁和逾１０个物流中心，再加上海港空港设施将构成完备的国际、国内、省内及区内交通网络。尤为值得注意者是正在形成的大湾区三级轨道网，包括市内地铁、城际快轨和出省铁路等，可形成全区的一小时经济及生活圈，有利于各市间的经济融合。在这基础上将可更合理地安排和优化产能布局，而各市均在产业发展上有大动作，着力打造在大湾区内的定位功能，并在落实上推行大开发、大产业及大项目的大展拳脚战略务求大干快上争占先机。广州和深圳将成为大湾区的双龙头，除作为综合枢纽外还要在科研及产业上占据最高端位置，从而引领全区发展，东莞则以建设「国际制造中心」为目标推动制造业升级走向高端。惠州则以绿色产业如生态旅游及健康产业等为号召。佛山则以「智造」为目标，利用科技把制造业升级。中山则以深中通道建设为契机带动发展。珠海则以发展科研及配合港珠澳大桥开通为发展重点。江门及肇庆则以连接粤西及大西南吸引投资。＊行政架构要创新重组＊

Particularly noteworthy is the formation of the Dawan District three-level rail network, including the urban subway, the inter-city express rail and the provincial railway, etc.,which can form a one-hour economic and living area in the whole region, which is conducive to economic integration among cities . On this basis, the layout of production capacity will be more reasonably arranged and optimized. However, all cities are making major moves in industrial development and strive to establish the positioning function in the Tai Wan District. In implementing the projects, large-scale development, large industries and large projects The bumper fist strategy to make big and quick to gain the upper hand. Guangzhou and Shenzhen will become dual-channel operators in the Greater Bay Area. In addition to being a comprehensive hub, they will also occupy the highest position in the research and industry, leading the development of the whole region. Dongguan will promote manufacturing upgrading with the goal of building an ""international manufacturing center"" Go to the high end. Huizhou Zeyi green industries such as eco-tourism and health industries for the call. Foshan aims at using ""smart manufacturing"" to upgrade manufacturing industry through technology. Zhongshan takes the opportunity of deep channel construction to drive development. Zhuhai is the development of scientific research and with the opening of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge for the development of focus. Jiangmen and Zhaoqing connect western Guangdong and the Southwest to attract investment. * Administrative structure to innovation and reorganization *
Each of the free trade zones in Guangdong is a hot spot for major investment and development. For instance, Nansha will be built as a port city in Tai Wan District. Major projects including the construction of the Central Business District and Hong Kong Industrial Park will attract major domestic and overseas investment and development projects. For instance, Shenzhen owns Tencent Holdings Limited (00700) to build ""Internet +"" technology City, and the establishment of coastal cultural park in Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town Co.,Ltd.,another example is Cisco to build wisdom network in Guangzhou. Many Hong Kong consortia have also actively involved such as establishing ""Hong Kong City"" in Qianhai and establishing a cultural and business start-up base in Hengqin and Nansha. The situation in Tai Wan District of Guangdong Province is gratifying. However, in the long run, some administrative structures still need to be adjusted and matched. First, to expand the area of ​​Shenzhen to lift the supply bottleneck of land supply, consider the integration of Dongguan into Shenzhen via Shenzhen's eastern integration and the incorporation of parts of Daya Bay in Huizhou. The other is to consider the Hengqin Island Line where the University of Macao, like the same governed by the management of Macao to expand the mechanism of ""one country, two systems"" innovation test, at the same time to compensate Zhuhai Gaolan Port Area into a free trade area to replace the original Hengqin function. Gaolan Free Trade Zone should also co-ordinate with the Daguang Bay Area in Jiangmen in the west to implement the division of labor and cooperation so as to drive the development of the west bank of the Pearl River and even the west of Guangdong.

雷达与防御性装备建设项目已大致完工，战机和移动式导弹发射器等可随时进驻。美国国防部认为，中方此举无助和平解决地区主权争议。有分析认为，由于中方有意在国际舞台领衔全球化、发力推动「一带一路」战略，南海局势倍显政治色彩。美国战略与国际研究中心（CSIS）分支机构「亚洲海事透明倡议」（AMTI）分析两年来衞星拍摄的照片表示，各人工岛于去年底至今年初全面完工，从3月9日至14日拍摄的永暑礁、美济礁、渚碧礁衞星照片，显示雷达与声纳阵列、停机棚、移动式导弹掩护装置和近迫武器系统等已建成。AMTI负责人波林表示，从照片可见永暑礁和渚碧礁有新的雷达天线阵，所以预计很快将进驻。中国在南沙群岛的这3个基地加上北面西沙永兴岛的另一个基地，将使解放军军机能在几乎整个南海执行任务，因为永暑、渚碧及华阳礁和永兴岛上均有先进监控及早期预警雷达设施，其他岛礁较小的设施亦能提供类似的雷达覆盖范围。外交部：中国主权范围中方还在永暑、渚碧与美济礁建设屋顶开合式掩护设施，供机动导弹发射车之用，永暑礁更有可供24架战机，以及包括轰炸机在内的3架大型飞机部署的飞机库。该组织还提到，中国一年多前在永兴岛设置红旗9地对空导弹，并一度在当地部署反舰导弹。美国国防部发言人罗斯以评论情报并非国防部事务为由拒绝置评，但表示中方持续在南海建设，证明该国继续採取愈来愈多的单方面行动，却加剧区域紧张，无助和平解决主权争议。中国外交部发言人华春莹昨天称，不了解该美国智库报告的具体情况，但中方多次表示，南沙群岛是中国固有领土，中国在自己领土上开展建设，
是为改善驻守人员的生活和工作条件，更好地维护自己的主权，更好地履行国际义务。至于中国在自己的领土上部署或不部署必要的国土防衞设施，这都是中国主权范围内的事。不过，澳洲智库洛伊国际政策研究所去年发表报告指出，中国在南海建立前哨基地网络，是把区域军事平衡扭向有利中方的战略性主动做法，因为这些战略性前哨基地将容许中国提高兵力投射能力，和有助发展出从海南岛向南伸延出来的「迷你反介入区」，能够用来有效地将美国海军逐出相关水道。报告认为，中国将能够扩大军方及海岸防衞队的攻击距离和持久力、前瞻部署空军、海军及海岸防衞队设备，和在有争议海域进行空中巡逻以支持未来公布的防空识别区。

","U.S. Means Nansha Military Infrastructure Completed U.S. Think Tanks According to the latest satellite photos, on the three artificial islands built by reclamation in Nansha, China conducted quay, airport,
Radar and defensive equipment construction project has been largely completed, fighters and mobile missile launchers can be stationed at any time. The U.S. Defense Department believes that the Chinese move will not help solve the regional dispute over the peaceful settlement of the issue. Some analysts believe that the situation in the South China Sea has become more political in the light of China's intention to lead the globalization in the international arena and make every effort to promote the ""One Belt and One Road"" strategy. According to a satellite image taken by the AMSI, a branch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) of the United States, the artisanal islands were fully completed from the end of last year to early this year. From March 9 to 14, Yongshu Reef, Meiji Reef, Zhu Bi Reef satellites, display of radar and sonar array, hangar, mobile missile shield and near-surface weapon system have been completed. Pauline, head of the AMTI, said that there are new radar antenna arrays on the Yongshu Reef and Zhubi Reef, so it is expected to be stationed soon. The addition of these three bases in the Nansha Islands to another base in Yongxing Island in the north of Xisha will allow the military capabilities of the People's Liberation Army to carry out its mission in almost the entire South China Sea since both Yongshu, Hubi and Huayang reefs and Yongxing Island have Advanced surveillance and early warning radar facilities, and other smaller reefs and similar facilities provide similar radar coverage. Ministry of Foreign Affairs: China Sovereignty China is also using roof opening and closing screening facilities at Yongshu, Zhu Bi and Meiji Reef for mobile missile launchers. The Yongshu Reef will also be able to provide 24 fighter jets and other facilities, including bombers Three large aircraft deployments hangar. The organization also mentioned that China set up more than a year ago the Red Flag's 9 surface-to-air missiles on Yongxing Island and once deployed anti-ship missiles locally. U.S. Defense Spokesman Rose declined to comment on the basis of comment not on the Ministry of National Defense. However, he said that China's continued construction in the South China Sea proves that the country continues to take more and more unilateral actions but aggravates regional tensions and will not help a peaceful settlement Sovereignty dispute. Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hua Chunying said yesterday that he did not understand the specific situation reported by the U.S. think-tank. However, China has repeatedly stated that the Nansha Islands are China's inherent territory and that China is building on its own territory.
It is aimed at improving the living and working conditions of the stationed personnel, better safeguarding their sovereignty and fulfilling their international obligations better. As for China, deploying or not deploying necessary national defense facilities in its own territory are all matters within the sovereignty of China. However, the Intelligence Institute in Australia issued a report last year on the issue of the establishment of an outpost base in the South China Sea by the Lockean Institute for International Policy. It is a strategic initiative to turn the regional military balance toward enabling China because these strategic outposts will allow China to increase its troop strength Ability and help to develop a ""mini anti-access zone"" extending south from Hainan Island can be used to effectively expel the U.S. Navy from the relevant watercourse. The report argues that China will be able to expand the attack range and stamina of the military and coast guard units, forward deployments of Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard equipment, and conduct air patrols in disputed areas in support of future air defense identification zones announced.",美指华南沙军事基建完工,Not Reuters,09:41AM 08 Jun 2017,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I1d33009013f011e7b2cfb833ae84e679.1C.html

","Nearly half of the land price rose nearly double the commercial land price chain breaking Nanfeng 24.6 billion won the Kai Tak King
Breaking the territory-wide land sales record Kai Kai Commercial Landmark, which was closed on last Friday, opened the bid yesterday by Nan Fung to force the remaining 11 Chinese and Hong Kong consortia to plunder over 246.6 billion yuan. The price per square foot is also as high as 12,863 yuan, which is nearly double that of the first batch of commercial land in the area six months ago. The premium of the land also breaks the record in the history of land sales in Hong Kong. King Gordon's seat on the Port of Hong Kong was more ""half-worth"" than the commercial land of Central Meridian Central awarded two weeks ago. In recent years, despite the fact that residential land plots have been won by Chinese-funded consortia, commercial land is still the ""bag thing"" for the large developers in Hong Kong. Last week's bid for the first commercial and hotel site at No. 2 F, Area F, First F, Kai Tak, with a total gross floor area of ​​over 1.9 million square feet, is the largest commercial site launched by the government in the past 17 years and has been the focus of the market since its launch . The Lands Department announced that it was awarded by Nan Fung at $ 24,609,998,888; equivalent to about $ 12,663 gross floor price per square foot . In recent years, the price of commercial land has been broken down by a series of roads.

This shows that the commercial land prices in the district have risen by nearly 10% in six months. In addition, the price of land in this area has also been raised above the upper limit of market valuation by more than 7%. 5% above the median price of Murray Road in Central Plains CAI Hong-hing, Managing Director of Nan Fung Development, described the location of the site at the center of ""East Kowloon"" with an initial estimated investment of more than $ 30 billion. It is estimated that more than half Grade A office space for the building, the other to provide shopping malls and hotels. He disclosed that due to the diversification of the project design and the provision of underground shopping arcades, it is not ruled out that the project will be launched in separate phases. Hopefully, the first phase will be the fastest floor to be completed in 2012. As the cost of the project hit a new high for Hong Kong's land sales market, Tsai Hong-hsing pointed out that due to the size of the project and the fact that East Kowloon will build two commercial centers in Hong Kong,
, While the Group itself has abundant financial resources and sufficient capital turnover, it has decided to compete at this price. Cai Hongxing: With a total investment of more than 30 billion Cai Hongxing said that due to the tight supply of Central commercial floors, it is expected that there will be demand for some office buildings and the relocation of East Kowloon. Therefore, the Group has been optimistic about the development in the area. Apart from the changes in industrial buildings As a commercial building, it has also won the commercial projects in the area. There will be a number of commercial launches for Kai Tak in the future. He said the group will also actively consider bidding for the tender. The land per square foot has the second highest price per square foot for Kowloon after Tsim Sha Tsui Central Tsim Sha Tsui won by about HK $ 4.7 billion three years ago. The price per square foot of the land is about $ 10,000 Three thousand yuan. Construction of Commercial and Hospitality Complex The Associated Executive Shop Manager Wong Han-cheng means that the market for second-hand commercial buildings in the area east of Kowloon is only about $ 10,000. This shows that this time, the ""flour price is higher than the bread price"" With the closure of the market and the tide of anti-tide, the trading volume in the next three months will be reduced and a situation of ""falling prices and rising prices"" will be formed. According to the Tenderers' Charter, the upper limit of 200 meters above the main level will create about 50 floors and will be the highest height building possible for the entire Kai Tak Development Area. The industry is expected to become the landmark of the area.

Buchbauer去年初表示，太阳能发电系统正慢慢改进，不少网友在网上留言期待产品推出。太阳能太阳花以太阳能作电源的手錶多年前已经登场，但近期一款充满港味的太阳能手錶引起大家关注，说的就是「木表」，其设计师Leon热爱大自然，希望让大家秒秒钟都欣赏大自然。据报，「木表」使用太阳能充电，并以回收木地板的木加工製造，同时又添加钢製内壳，借此保护手錶运动免入水受潮和磨损。最近有美国设计师打造太阳能花形LED枱灯，外形似足太阳花，情侣们可用作「灯光晚餐」，或作为亲子阅读时间的照明等，用家只需要早上把花蕊部分的太阳板面向室外受日光照射，至日落便可以拿进房间使用。特别一提，这花是以3D打印技术製成，预计今年底推出。爱尔兰都柏林的智能城市计划，打算在公共场所设置800个高科技太阳能垃圾桶，该计划的成本将近500万欧罗（约4226万港元）。智能垃圾桶透过可再生能源（太阳能）提供动力来处理垃圾，据说可处理高达800升废物，是传统垃圾桶的6至8倍。同时垃圾桶具有无线监控系统，当使用量达到85%时，相关管理部门会接获通知，好让清空垃圾桶。相片：网上图片撰文

Arena），便可在山岗小村庄写意滑雪，登上峰顶远眺壮丽的世遗冰川呢！ 文、图：韦利鸣谢：瑞士国家旅游局、瑞士国际航空环保小庄 新手体验
瑞士阿尔卑斯山山脉优美如画，单纯举目观赏雪岭风光，已是妙不可言，然而说到要挑战的积雪连峰，滑雪初哥总不免有点犹豫。只怪雪国名山太过巍峨雄伟，常予人只属高手阵营的错觉，其实瑞士名山上的滑雪场，对初级滑雪者绝非「高不可攀」。事实上，瑞士一众滑雪名所，除具优良雪质，不少更备有新手适宜的初阶滑雪场地和路线，难得的是，瑞士旅游局今年更推出了「一日滑雪体验」计划（One
Day Ski Experience），在全国各地挑选十九个地点，提供专为初学者而设的优惠滑雪课程，让初哥们能以合理价钱，体验瑞士的雪地乐趣。
据悉参与此体验计划的地点，包括了策马特、铁力士峰、达沃斯、格林德尔瓦尔德等知名瑞士滑雪地，这次的体验据点，则是未算广为人熟悉的阿莱奇地区（Aletsch
Arena）。可别以为这个瓦莱州上的高原地区名气稍逊，当地除是大名鼎鼎的世界遗产——阿莱奇冰川的所在地，更可找到宁静遗世的环保小村庄，包括Riederalp、Bettmeralp和Fiescheralp在内的几个海拔二千米的小镇，均完全禁止燃油汽车行走，空气纯淨清新，加上有马特洪峰作为背景，环境更是动人。惟更吸引的是，这个每年12月至翌年4月皆为滑雪季节的地区，各村的滑雪场均与酒店异常接近，部份甚至正在雪场旁边，游人下榻于此，便可直接「Ski-
in Ski-out」，省时便捷。再登顶峰
环迴赏景在雪地玩得尽兴，几乎忘记了时间，过了中午，人渐感到疲累，此时在雪场旁的餐厅用过地道佳餚，便再转移阵地享受静态一面。我们乘坐另一缆车，向区内最高点、海拔达二千九百二十六米的艾基斯峰（Eggishorn）进发，只见沿途尽是铺蚑J皑白雪的险要山岩，景色雄奇壮丽，来到峰顶的观景台位置，纯白世界更美得让人目瞪口呆，不但脚下是全欧洲最长、足达二十三公里的阿莱奇冰川，举目远眺，更有三百六十度的环迴雪峰美景，除了前方的阿莱奇峰，瑞士马特洪峰和少女峰，就连法国白朗峰和意大利一方的阿尔卑斯山脉也尽收眼底。一日滑雪体验
瑞士除了是雪上运动的始祖，其源于1864年的冬季旅游，也是历史悠久，值得到当地一游，感受雪国气氛。
若打算到阿莱奇地区参加一日滑雪体验，只要登入瑞士旅游局网页，便可找到相关连结，其滑雪套餐价钱每位510瑞士法郎（约3,930港元），已包Hotel
Royal一晚双人房住宿连早餐及四道菜晚餐之馀，尚包滑雪装备租借、三小时滑雪课程及滑雪证、午餐及乘缆车登上观景台欣赏阿莱奇冰川的行程。
另外，现凡购买任何瑞士冬季旅游套餐，如机票加酒店住宿，瑞士交通证连一天滑雪体验课程等产品，便可以凭收据到瑞士国家旅游局香港办事处，免费换取包含小型雪橇、瑞士冬季旅游册子及地图在内的限量版冬季玩雪乐礼品一份，详情可向该局查询。旅游备忘持BNO护照或特区护照前往瑞士均毋须签证。查询：www.dfae.admin.ch/hongkong（瑞士联邦总领事馆）SWISS瑞士国际航空由香港至苏黎世，来回经济客位票价约6,560港元起，已连税项及相关附加费。网页：www.swiss.com入住Art

With the Matterhorn as a backdrop, the environment is even more moving.

王笈巴山蜀水的川江号子、夜郎之国的侗族大歌……作为第34届上海之春国际音乐节的重头戏之一，来自中国西南地区彝族、藏族、土家族等少数民族的独特音乐瑰宝9日晚“踏春”来到上海东方艺术中心，以一场《锦绣中华·魅力西南音乐会》向世人展示了中华文化“百花园”的无穷魅力。一曲时而悠扬、时而激越的原生态表演唱《川江号子》将观众带到了奔流不息的川江，聆听川江船工多姿多彩的“生命交响”。“川江”是四川省和重庆市境内各条江河的统称；“川江号子”则是四川民歌中川江船工劳作时所唱的劳动号子，多为口耳相传、自然传承，是中国第一批国家级非物质文化遗产。领唱该曲的国家一级演员李静涛已在舞台上传承了近10年的川江号子，“川江自古水流湍急，容易船毁人亡。我们唱川江号子，也是传承了川江船工在如此艰险的自然环境下，百折不挠、吃苦耐劳、勇往直前的精神。”世界非物质文化遗产“侗族大歌”则是中国西南地区侗族人久唱不衰的一种古歌。侗族是一个无文字民族，用歌进行交流和记忆，侗家人故此“嗜歌如命”。作为一种多声部、无指挥、无伴奏、自然和声的民间合唱形式，侗族大歌无论音律结构、演唱技艺等都与一般的民间歌曲有所不同。“今晚的侗族大歌《春蝉》主要表现的是春天将至、鸟儿歌唱的一种景色。”贵州民族大学音乐舞蹈学院少数民族特色音乐系主任奚岩告诉记者，“我们还带来了侗族的车江琵琶歌《歌唱心声话情谊》、苗族的《云顶欢歌》、土家族的《这山没得那山高》和彝族的《牧歌》。贵州是一个多民族的省份，侗族、彝族、苗族、土家族这四个民族是贵州主要世居的少数民族。”令观众耳目一新的是，当晚的音乐会除保留传统少数民族音乐原生态的旋律和韵味，如《川江号子》等不少曲目还加入了多种现代音乐元素，为这些古老的民族音乐再添“创新翅膀”。“原生态的川江号子相对比较单调，我们在唱法、配器等方面都进行了提高，在严格保留原生态音乐特性的基础上，加入一些现代音乐和西方音乐的元素。比如以前的川江号子声部不是很丰富，今天我们增加一个声部，而且形成了复调，肢体上也进行了丰满和加工。”李静涛告诉记者。演唱当晚《云顶欢歌》的“苗族歌王”蝶当久（潘兴周）走的也不是“地地道道”的原生态苗歌传承之路。为了让更多年轻人接受这一少数民族歌种，蝶当久已探索多年，将苗族的音乐元素与现代流行音乐相结合，整理、改编创作了一系列苗族歌曲。蝶当久告诉记者，唱歌是苗族生活的一部分，过去苗族人通过对歌谈恋爱，如今许多年轻人却已不再唱苗歌，“苗族的历史正渐渐被澹忘，需要我们去搜集资料，挖掘、抢救那些苗族文化遗产。”正如蝶当久的名字——长长久久地将苗族文化代代传承。（完）

华置（00127）、会德丰地产、南丰发展，以及鲜有入标的中渝置地（01224）等。会德丰地产物业估价及研究高级经理何伟锦入标后指出，美利道项目景观开扬，是次以独资形式入标，考虑出价时「计自己数」。该项目相对之下较少中资发展商入标，较瞩目为世茂房地产（00813），伙拍信置（00083）和新世界发展（00017）递交标书。资料显示，美利道商业地的地盘面积3.1万方呎，可建楼面约46.5万方呎，市场估值约139.5亿至223.2亿元，每方呎楼面地价（下称楼面呎价）约3万至4.8万元。对于美利道项目的招标反应，高力国际亚洲区估价及谘询副常务董事张翘楚认为，标书数目较预期略少，估计由于中资发展商喜欢现金回转较快的发展项目，加上近来内地对资金流的控制较严，可能令部分中资公司打消竞投涉及大银码地皮的念头。中原(工商舖)写字楼部区域营业董事蔡德宝表示，美利道商业地推出招标后，该区商厦反价及封盘个桉频仍，估计美利道项目批出后中区商厦买卖及租务交投将更炽热。内地财团觊觎1K区1号地除美利道商业地外，位于启德发展区的第1K区1号地盘住宅地，同步在周五截标。项目可建楼面面积约57.55万方呎，中资财团的反应较踊跃，地政总署共收到16份标书，涉及起码21家发展商，最少7家为中资财团，包括保利置业（00119）、华润置地（01109）、龙光地产（03380）、万科置业（香港），与路劲基建（01098）合资的深圳控股（00604），以及伙拍新世界发展的招商局置业，中国海外（00688）则与信置和爪哇控股（00251）合作入标。嘉华国际（00173）去年12月投得毗邻的第1K区2号地盘，该集团香港地产发展及租务总监尹紫薇表示，嘉华国际在启德区内已有两个项目，看好该区前景，故是次亦有入标。中原测量师行执行董事张竞达认为，启德用地的招标反应合乎预期，相信中资财团看重启德住宅地皮，有机会继续高价抢地以扩充版图。

","9 Prosperity Road Commercial King Market is in strong demand of core district offices. Lands Department launched the bidding for the commercial area of ​​Central America Murray Road, setting off a scramble for developers in Hong Kong. Although the market estimated the premium of the land to be as high as Rmb23.3bn at any time, it successfully attracted 9 consortia into the bidding at the time of closing the tender on Friday, mainly by local developers [Table 1]. As for another residential site in the redevelopment of East Kai Tak in Kowloon that is closed on the same day, a minimum of 21 developers have been formed to compete for 16 consortia. The Chinese desire to grab land is significantly stronger, at least 7 (Table 2).
Murray Road Hong Kong capital-dominated Murray Road commercial area at the junction of Murray Road and Queensway, formerly a multi-storey car park, belonging to the government's first commercial supply in Central District in more than 20 years, successfully attracted at least 11 developers The nine consortia formed a tender, including Cheung Kong (01113), Hengdi (00012), SUN HUNG KAI PROPERTIES LIMITED (00016),

After the listing of WHEELOCK AND COMPANY LIMITED, a senior manager of real estate property valuation and research, pointed out that the landscape of the Murray Road project has been on the rise. This time, the bidding was conducted on a sole proprietorship basis. Relatively few Chinese developers bid for the project, with more attention being paid to bid for SHIMAO PROPERTY HOLDINGS LIMITED (00813), PHARMACO (00083) and NEW WORLD DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED (00017). According to the statistics, the commercial area of ​​Murray Road in the commercial area is 31,000 square feet and the gross floor area is 465,000 square feet.

For the bidding response of the Murray Road project, Zhang Alice Chu, Deputy Managing Director of Colliers International Asia, believes that the number of tender proposals is slightly less than expected.

CENTRAL CHINA SECURITIES CO.,LTD. (商 铺)) Office of the Regional Office of the Director Cai Debao said that after the commercial launch of the Murray Road Commercial Auction, the bidding prices for the commercial buildings in the district and the frequency of closure of the commercial premises were still high.

WAH INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LIMITED has two locations in Kai Tak A project, optimistic about the prospects for the area, it is also the time the tender. Mr. Zhang Jingda, Executive Director of Surveyors, believes that the bidding response of Kai Tak site is in line with expectation.

Meeker），在美国Code大会上发佈二○一七年的互联网趋势报告，揭示了现时全球互联网的发展大势。这是米克尔第二十二次发表这个年度报告，可以说是业内权威。报告提到全球互联网用户数目已超过三十四亿，较去年增长百分之十，互联网全球渗透率达到百分之四十六。智能手机的发展开始放缓，去年出货量增长百分之三，远低于二○一五年增长的百分之十，增速大为减慢。但互联网广告方兴未艾，二○一六年美国网络广告支出七百三十亿美元，按年增长百分之二十二，报告预计全球网络广告将于半年内超过电视广告。当中移动广告已经超越桌面电脑广告。网上电子商务的发展迅速，全球的包裹量去年增长百分之九，再加上亚马逊等巨型电商纷纷开设实体店，令到传统零售店饱受冲击。去年美国地面零售店有二千家倒闭，估计今年倒闭的数目会急升至七千家，可以说是传统零售业的灾难。中国移动互联网用户数字增长惊人，已经超过七亿，按年增长百分之十二。去年中国互联网用户，有百分之五十五使用媒体的时间花在互联网上，已经超越了电视的时间。中国有些互联网领域已经成为世界第一，去年中国的游戏市场趋近二百五十亿美元，超过美国收益，成为世界第一。在出行共享方面，已升到世界首位，每年出行共享次数超过百亿（包含了汽车和单车出行），单是中国出行量已超过全球半数，远超北美的数量。中国的电子商务的渗透率也非常快，去年电子商佔零售总额百分之十五，已经进佔全球第二位，仅次于韩国。最后看看全球互联网领导企业的市值排名，排第一的是苹果；排第二位的是谷歌；第三位是亚马逊；第四位是脸书；第五位是腾讯；第六位是阿里巴巴。首二十位的公司堶情A中国佔了七家，美国佔了十二家，中国公司在互联网市场上，与美国亦步亦趋，力量惊人。互联网是中国的先进领域，以跳跃式发展，远比香港前嚏C认识中国的落后，是希望中国可以作出改变，会变得更好；认识中国的先进，是寻找香港可以学习的地方，也为自己寻找工作机会。很多家长很重视子女的前途，了解中国的先进产业，特别是科技的发展，对子女将来的就业前途，有莫大关係。•逢周二至六见报wh.lo@bastillepost.com「巴士的报」是一份网上报纸，让网民随时随地拿茪熅魕峊酊O电脑可以看到。www.bastillepost.com

","It is like a giant elephant to see China's advanced and backward China at the same time. If you look at her from different angles, you will find totally different images. In 2016, the per capita output value of China is 8,866 yuan, about 69,000 Hong Kong dollars, and 5800 yuan per month, which is a medium-income country. However, we must not forget that this is only an average number of peasants who are still poor in inland mountainous areas and earn only a few hundred yuan a month. In the metropolitan areas, there are many rich people. We should have a balanced view of China and do not think she is advanced because there are still many backward places in China, including culture and system. However, we can not think that she is too backward. At present, many young people in Hong Kong hate China and do not want to set foot on it China. Their impression of China is only waste oil and fake and shoddy goods, dirty and backward. In reality, however, China has gone in the forefront of the world in many aspects and we must recognize these facts. Just saw a news, the ""Queen of the Internet,"" said Wall Street analyst Mikel (Mary
Meeker), released the 2017 Internet Trend Report at the Code Conference in the United States, revealing the current development trend of the global Internet. This is the twenty-second issue of this annual report by Mikel, arguably the industry's authority. The report mentions that the number of Internet users worldwide has exceeded 3.4 billion, an increase of 10% over the previous year and the global penetration rate of the Internet has reached 46%. The development of smartphones started to slow down. Shipments last year rose 3%, well below the growth of 10% in 2015, and the growth rate slowed a lot. However, Internet advertising was on the rise. US online advertising expenditures in 2016 were 73 billion U.S. dollars, up 22% over the previous year. The report predicts that global online advertising will overtake television commercials in six months. Among them, mobile advertising has surpassed desktop advertising. The rapid development of online e-commerce, the global volume of parcels last year increased by 9%, coupled with Amazon and other giants have opened a physical store, so that the impact of traditional retail stores. Last year, there were 2,000 floor closures on the ground in the United States. It is estimated that the number of closures this year will soar to 7,000. This can be described as a disaster in the traditional retail industry. China Mobile Limited The number of Internet users increased dramatically, exceeding 700 million, a year-on-year increase of 12%. Last year, Internet users in China, 55 percent of the time spent using the media on the Internet, have already surpassed television time. Some of China's Internet field has become the No. 1 in the world. Last year, the game market in China approached 25 billion U.S. dollars, surpassing the U.S. revenue and becoming the No. 1 in the world. In terms of travel sharing, it has risen to the top of the world with more than 10 billion travel trips (including cars and cycling trips) each year. Travel alone in China has surpassed half of the world trips, far exceeding the number of North American countries. The penetration rate of e-commerce in China is also very fast. Last year, e-commerce accounted for 15% of total retail sales, taking the second place in the world and second only to South Korea. Finally, take a look at the global Internet market leader in the rankings, ranked first in Apple; ranked second is Google; third is Amazon; fourth is Facebook; fifth is Tencent Holdings Limited; sixth Alibaba The top 20 companies accounted for seven cases in China, while the United States accounted for twelve. Chinese companies, on the Internet market, walked the pace with the United States with staggering strength. The Internet is an advanced area in China. With leaps and bounds, it is far more backward than Hong Kong to know China's backwardness. It is hoped that China will make changes and will become better. To recognize China's advanced state is to find a place where Hong Kong can learn. Find job opportunities for yourself. Many parents attach great importance to their children's future. Understanding the advanced industries in China, especially the development of science and technology, has a great bearing on the future employment prospects of their children. • Every Tuesday to Saturday wh.lo@bastillepost.com Bus Guide is an online newspaper that allows Internet users to access the Internet at anytime, anywhere. www.bastillepost.com",要同时领略中国的先进与落后,Not Reuters,01:10AM 20 May 2016,file:///C:\Users\uc238618\Desktop\TR-Intern\Web App\Data/Articles/articles_1000_NewsRoom\I1eaa64a0480111e7b4aab1d20f64f116.1C.html

Coffee饮咖啡及试了驰名的鸡蛋三文治，是一个bonus。去年7月决定今年与姪女两夫妇再到京都旅游，于是请他介绍一些餐厅。他除了给好些建议，还帮我们订了预先想去的餐厅。这份工作绝不简单。今次曾尝试亲身在Tempura
Matsu为朋友订位，虽然已一星期之内去了两次，他们也认得我，但就算先付现金，还是被拒绝了，在此要跟陈俊伟说声感谢。话说在Ritz-Carlton
Kyoto吃罢了一餐非常高质素的铁板烧，也想把这个好地方介绍给一位即将前来一起旅游的好友，可惜铁板烧一连几日已订满，与姪女商量，觉得他们的天妇罗也应该做得不错，于是转移阵地到另外一边吃天妇罗了。水晖天妇罗一样只有8个座位，当日除了我们5个人，另外一边有两位日本客人。午餐有两款，分别是5000和8000日圆。两款午餐均有前菜、10件天妇罗和甜品。8000日圆的一款多了两件刺身、野菜沙律，天妇罗有两隻海虾，亦有带子，饭是天茶渍，极之丰富。值得一试天妇罗关西天妇罗粉浆比关东的薄，水晖并非配天妇罗汁，而是有4款靓盐以供选择。厨师炸天妇罗水准非常高，每一件天妇罗炸好后，厨师从镬里拿出，随即用筷子把每件炸物用力抖动，将多馀油分尽量挥走，天妇罗放在纸上没有油分释出，脆浆非常薄，而每种食材炸得刚刚好，虾头炸到脆脆的，很好吃，是高手之作！材料方面，海鲜非常新鲜，每一款野菜是挑选过的。跟铁板烧餐厅一样，材料、环境、厨师质素及服务态度均无得弹，庆幸做了这个明智决定，去同一餐厅吃两次，绝对值得大家一试。同样一句说话，这样高质素的天妇罗餐厅在香港需要双倍价钱呢。Ritz-

","Continuation of Gourmet Food Tour in Kyoto (D) Over the past two weeks, I went to D100 twice. I was invited by food writer Mr. Chen Junwei to share his food experience of ""Kyoto Food"" with his host, ""Food from the Stars."" In fact, this is the second trip on the same program, the first time in January 2015. At that time, PR said Chen Junwei invited me to his diet program. Chen Junwei is a senior diet and travel writer, columnist, radio travel show host, food critic, before we have not had the chance to meet. At that time there are still a few weeks is the Lunar New Year, is an important day selling rice cakes, Chen Junwei would like to visit the experience of doing food business. Famous Foodies Recommended Food ""Food from the Stars"" is a two-hour diet that goes out on Fridays. Chen Junwei has presided over the program for more than three years, often to all over the world, try different cuisine, but I have not tried my cakes, he proposed to my home first try my product, also take this to know each other. The same day was Sunday, and he used the entire afternoon to understand my background and try each pastry. In fact, he only needs to talk over the phone and does not have to spend a few hours interviews. He is respecting himself and his interviewees, reflecting his rigor in his work. After a few days to the radio interview, because of the preparation, two hours of video will be very easy, it is easy, is a pleasure. Chen Junwei, originally Japan's tourism ambassador for Kansai, should know a lot about the Kansai region so he told us that we will also travel to Kyoto by the end of February. He happened to be in Kyoto one day, and he even invited us to visit this ancient capital with his two other friends and admire Meihua Holdings Group Co.,Ltd.,
Coffee drinking coffee and try the famous egg sandwiches, is a bonus. Last July, I decided to go to Kyoto with my niece and my wife this year and invited him to introduce some restaurants. Apart from giving some advice, he also helped us set the restaurant in advance. This job is by no means easy. This time I tried to stay in Tempura
Matsu reserved a friend for a friend. Although they had gone twice in a week, they also recognized me. However, even if they paid cash in advance or were refused, they would like to thank Chen Junwei. Speaking at Ritz-Carlton
Kyoto Eat a very high quality Teppanyaki, would also like to introduce this good place to a friend who is about to travel together, but unfortunately Teppanyaki has been booked for a few days, and I discuss, think they Tempura should also be doing well, so move to the other side to eat tempura. Shuhui tempura just as 8 seats, the same day except us five people, on the other side there are two Japanese guests. There are two lunch, respectively, 5000 and 8000 yen. Both lunches have appetizers, 10 tempura and desserts. 8000 yen a more than two pieces of sashimi, sauerkraut, tempura has two shrimp, also have tape, rice is a day of rice, very rich. Worth a try tempura Kansai tempura pulp than the Kanto thin, water Hui is not with tempura, but there are 4 pretty salt to choose from. Chef fry Tempura high standards, each tempura fried, the chef took out from the khaki, then chopsticks with a force to shake each piece of fry, the extra oil as far as possible, tempura on There is no oil on the paper to release, brittle pulp is very thin, and just fried for each kind of food just, fried shrimp head to crunchy, very delicious, is a master! Materials, seafood is very fresh, each one is picked wild vegetables. Like the Teppanyaki restaurant, there is no material, environment, chef quality and service attitude. Fortunately, making this wise decision and going to the same restaurant twice, it is definitely worth a try. The same sentence, so high-quality tempura restaurant in Hong Kong need double price yet.

I1f191c70f7a611e6aa3badc846321daa.1C,"两种演绎我对演员妮坦莉．宝雯谈不上喜爱，但素常敬佩她的努力。从《这个杀手不太冷》到《黑天鹅》，在成长的岁月里努力不懈，屡获殊荣。但她的角色纵然变化多端，演技的幅度始终有限，她演喜剧便常常失败。她的淑女气质使她的演技显得拘谨，演压抑及略带黑色的角色，发挥较能淋漓尽致。因此儘管有人大讚她担正大旗的《第一夫人：积琪莲甘迺迪》，我还是等到近期才有兴致去看。关于宝雯如何锻炼自己演出积琪莲本人的声线，报道重複又重複，莫论她如何努力真诚，我还是有点抗拒。显然宝雯跟积琪莲的距离，在她们是两个截然不同的人；一个由贵族贵为第一夫人，另一个是努力扮演积琪莲的演员。如果能放下「替身」的情结，宝雯这个人应会更好地「演活」难以取代的积琪莲，在这个家喻户晓的第一夫人的遗说（Legacy）中，注入一种可以如何理解她的可能。以积琪莲接受CBS电视台访问游白宫的实录片段，跟宝雯后来解说她在电影中如何演绎积琪莲的声音一段比较，便是一项说明。在该段着名的纪录节目里，积琪莲小心翼翼地介绍白宫宴会厅及设置的每件器皿，以及画作。她显然作过充分准备，对资料耳熟能详，娓娓道来如数家珍。但那是积琪莲自己的声音，听来只感到她因为肩负重任，要为自己在白宫所作的品味选择和营造负责，显得有点紧张，甚至压低了声线。但这种情景宝雯是取其形似，为模彷而模彷，只会提醒人她跟积琪莲的距离。积琪莲喜爱阅读，精于骑马、摄影与绘画。她具有法国血统，在外交场所会以流利法言和几种外语接待嘉宾，为第一夫人的身份添加素养，这是美国众人皆知的事实。她在法国巴黎大学学习，在乔治华盛顿大学习画，造就了她一定的自信。惟上世纪六十年代的性别角色只能让她面对社会对「第一夫人」的期待。她曾说这个称号跟宠物命名没有分别；但她还是战战兢兢地担当好这个社会角色。宝雯演绎积琪莲较好的一段，在她跟积琪莲邀请来写自己传记的作家的面谈。积琪莲的愤忿、她的霸道以及操控，在坦白与隐瞒和否认之间的转移，流露了一个极其可信的可能。积琪莲当然喜欢贵气、良好品味，能保持自己的典雅和家人的安全；她绝不脆弱，而是具有一番连脆弱也得表露于人前来换取肯定的顽强。儘管宝雯或许会继续凭此片夺得最佳女演员的殊荣，但她的刻意，反映了一个演员与角色的距离。近期观赏的另一项演绎，乃韩裔女歌剧家曹秀美在香港管弦乐团音乐会演唱玛丽亚．卡拉丝的首本名唱。曹秀美说自小便经常因为母亲的喜爱，昼夜听卡拉丝的歌声，如此影响了她日后以声乐为志业的选择未定。不经不觉，今年乃卡拉丝逝世四十周年，香港管弦乐团特此邀请曹秀美献唱卡拉丝的经典名曲。曹秀美当然也是「美声唱法」的能手，能表现卡拉丝清亮灵巧的歌法，但她没有刻意化身为卡拉丝。她时而华丽时而调皮的活泼表演，没有卡拉丝一生感情生活颠沛（其长期爱人奥纳西斯捨她而娶积琪莲．甘迺迪）的沉重。曹秀美的演绎，观众甘之如饴。注：隔周二刊出

","Two kinds of deduction I actress Nittanie. Bao-Wen talk about love, but always admire her efforts. From ""this killer is not too cold"" to ""black swan"", in the growing years of hard work, award-winning. However, even though her role is changing and his acting skills are always limited, she often fails to play comedy. Her ladylike temperament made her acting cautious, playing a role of suppressing and slightly black, play more vividly. So although someone praised her for the banner of the ""First Lady: Jiqi Lian Gan Di Di,"" I still wait until the recent interest only to see. About Bao Wen how to exercise their performance Ji Qilian my voice, repeated and repeated reports, Mo how she worked hard in good faith, I still a little resistance. Obviously Bao Wen with the distance from the lotus, in which they are two very different people; one by the nobility as the first lady, and the other is trying to play as Ji Qilian actor. If you can put aside ""complex"" complex, Bao Wen this person should be better ""play live"" Hard to replace Katie Lian, in the legacy of this well-known first lady Legacy, into a can understand how She may. With Katie Lian CBS television interview with the White House visit to reality, and Bao Wen later explained her in the movie how to interpret the voice of Katie's lot, is a description. In this well-known record-breaking program, Katie carefully introduces the White House banquet hall and every set of dishes and paintings. Apparently well-prepared for her, she is familiar with the data and is familiar with her. But it was Katie's own voice, which only seemed to me that she was responsible for the tastes and choices she made at the White House because of her heavy responsibilities. She seemed a bit nervous and even depressed her voice. However, this scenario Bao Wen is taking its shape, imitation and imitation, only to remind her of the distance with the lotus. Ji Qilian likes to read, good at riding, photography and painting. It is a well-known fact in the United States that she has a French origin, receives fluent French law and diplomas in diplomatic forums and serves as first lady. She studied at the University of Paris in France, drawing painting at George Washington University, creating a certain degree of confidence in her. However, the gender role in the 1960s only allowed her to face the social expectations of ""First Lady."" She said there was no difference between the title and the pet's name; however, she still trembled with her social role. Bao Wen interpretation Katie lotus a better period, she and Ji Qi Lin invitation to write a biography of the author's interview. Katie's anger, her hegemony and manipulation, in the confession and concealment and denial of the transfer between the show a very credible possibility. Of course she likes extravagance and good taste. She can maintain her own elegance and her family's safety. She is definitely not vulnerable, but she has some tenaciousness that she has to be exposed to others in exchange for affirmation. Although Bao Wen may continue to rely on this film won the best actress award, but she deliberately reflects the distance between an actor and role. Another recent interpretation of the interpretation of the Korean female singer Cao Xiumei concert in Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra Maria. Callas's first name sung. Cao Xiu-mei said that often since childhood, because of his mother's love, day and night to listen to Carasi's singing, thus affecting her vocal music for future career choices undecided. Unaware that this year is the fortieth anniversary of the death of Kalasi, the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra hereby invited Cao Xiumei singing Calassi's classic songs. Of course, Cao Xiumei was also a ""virtuoso singer"" capable of expressing Kalasi's clever and clever song, but she did not deliberately turn into a Karasi.

I21a898a0e84a11e698f8df46307a8099.1C,"金鸡报喜 猴年将尽之际，环球股市今周却大发神威，美股屡创新高的同时，港股也顺势升穿23000点大关。鸡年伊始，香江，以至全人类股市会否金鸡报喜？
投资者大可聚焦以下股债滙指标，以观测市场气氛的好澹，特别是「特朗普行情」情绪的盛衰。大兴土木 基建板块强
股市方面，既看大，又看小。大，是指美股两大指数：纳指及罗素2000小型股指数（RTY）。
纳指为猴尾拉动美股向上的火车头，惟指数连连走高后，14天相对强弱指数（RSI）已升至70以上的超买水平，渐现调整压力。周四（26日），纳指先升后软，呈小阴烛，并合成「澹友反攻」组合，初现澹意。一旦纳指失守1月13日前浪顶支持5584，便大有可能展开调整，敲响特氏升浪告终的警号。
同样，主要受本土经济强弱左右的RTY，亦反映市场人士对口口声「美国优先」的特氏的观感。
查实，RTY于去年12月高见1392点后回落，呈下降通道，走势已比其他主要指数为弱。若RTY迟迟未能升穿1400的同时，反而掉头跌穿1月23日的前浪底支持1341，或是市场人士对特氏行情信心渐失的徵兆。
小的，可看美股个别板块的上落。起初，市场焦点是金融、工业股，取金融股为新政府放宽监管的受惠股，另一则得益于「买美国货，僱美国人」的政策。
随着特氏天天签署总统行政命令，陆续兑现选举承诺，包括重新推动输油管道建设项目，并强调项目所需钢材必须产自美国；同时，又宣布于美国、墨西哥边境兴建围牆等。
消息传来，市场人士乃将目光转向美股中的基建、原材料板块，其中SPDR原材料精选ETF延续去年底的强势，2017年进一步上涨，至今累升约5%。属基建板块的安硕全球基建ETF、ProShares道琼斯全球基建ETF亦保持强势，股民亦可看紧上述几大板块ETF的表现。债息上扬
不利全球股市 滙市方面，还看美滙指数及亚洲货币指数（ADXY）。
先有特氏一声美元太强，美国企业无法竞争；再加候任财长努钦一句：美元过度强势，市场人士勐然惊觉，新政府或会施行弱美元政策，以提高美国产品竞争力；一时间，美滙指数备受冲击，曾失守100点大关。
不过，美滙的噩耗，却是新兴市场（EM）货币及股市的佳音，往往促使资金投向EM货币及股市，并带动ADXY重上104.5点水平。
只是美滙近日似有喘定迹象，反之ADXY却有短期见顶之虞。若美滙后市升穿50天綫101.6点，ADXY又下破1月17日前浪底及50天綫所在的103.6点，或反映滙市中人并不卖特氏的帐，小股民就要做好美元转强，资金或会由EM股滙撤出的打算。
至于债市方面，当然要定睛于美国10年期国债孳息的表现。
美债息经一轮整固，低见2.3厘（债息跌，即债价升）后，今周再度回升，周五曾报2.52厘，升穿中期下降轨，并似蓄势挑战前浪顶2.64厘。债息上扬，可是市场人士对特氏财政政策的反弹，又定必增添环球资金成本上涨的忧虑，都对包括港股在内的全人类股市不利。
既然如此，一旦美债息突破2.64厘阻力，投资者就要提高警觉，不要闻鸡起舞了。

","Hong Kong stocks also climbed through the 23,000-point mark on the up trend while US stocks hit record highs again this week. At the beginning of the chicken, Hong Kong, and even the human stock market will be good news?
Investors can focus on the following indicators of stock debt to observe the market sentiment good, especially the ""Trump Quotes,"" the ups and downs of emotions. Daxing strong civil infrastructure blocks
Stock market, both big and small. Large, refers to the two major US stocks index: Nasdaq and Russell 2000 Small Cap Index (RTY).
The Nasdaq helped to lift US stocks upward for the monkey tail. However, after the index rose again, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose to the overbought level of 70 and gradually adjusted its pressure. On Thursday (26th), the Nasdaq first rose softly, showing a small black candlestick, and formed the ""Choo Friends"" counter-offensive combination. Once the Nasdaq falls to support 5584 by Top Wave on January 13, it is highly likely that adjustments will be made to slam the alarm that has ended.
Similarly, RTY, which is largely dominated by the strength of the local economy, also reflects the perception of market participants over the ""American-preferred"" Tesco.
As a result, RTY dropped after dropping from 1392 in December last year, showing a downward spiral. The trend has been weaker than the other major indices. If RTY has not been able to rise above 1400 lately, it will turn around and drop through the previous wave of 1323 on January 23 to support the 1341, or market sentiment on the market's loss of confidence.
Small, you can see the United States stocks up and down the individual sections. Initially, the focus of the market was on financial and industrial stocks. Taking financial stocks as a beneficiary of deregulation by the new government, the other benefited from the policy of ""buying American goods and hiring Americans.""
With Tesco's signing of executive orders every day, Tesco has successively fulfilled its electoral promises, including re-promoting oil pipeline construction projects, emphasizing that steel needed in the project must be produced in the United States. At the same time, it announced the construction of a fence at the U.S.-Mexico border.
It is reported that market participants are turning their gainers to the infrastructure and raw materials sectors in the US market. Among them, the SPDR Raw Materials Select ETF continued its strong performance at the end of last year and further rose in 2017, soaring by about 5% so far. The ISS, the infrastructure-based Issey Global Infrastructure ETF, and the ProShares Dow Jones Global Infrastructure ETF also remain strong, and investors are able to keep a close eye on the performance of the ETFs in these major sectors.

Adverse global stock market currency, but also look at the United States exchange rate index and the Asian currency index (ADXY).
First Teshouyi dollar too strong, the United States can not compete with the company; plus appointed Finance Minister Nocqin one dollar: the dollar is too strong, market players suddenly surprised that the new government may impose weak dollar policy to improve the competitiveness of US products ; For a time, the dollar index has been hit, has lost 100 mark.
However, the bad news of the US sinking, but it is a good news for the SINCERE NAVIGATION CORPORATION market (EM) currency and the stock market, often led to the EM money and the stock market and driven ADXY back to 104.5 level.
Only the United States seems to have wheezing signs of recent days, whereas ADXY there is the risk of short-term peak. If the United States after the market rose above the 50 antenna 101.6 points, ADXY and broke the wave of the bottom before January 17 and 50 antenna where the 103.6 points, or reflect the currency does not sell Teshur account, small investors should do the dollar turn Strong, funding or by the EM shares withdrawn from the plan.
As for the bond market, of course, we must look closely at the performance of the 10-year U.S. government bond yield.
After a round of consolidations, the U.S. debt interest rate saw a low of 2.3% (debt interest rate dropped, that is, the debt price rose). It rose again this week. It hit 2.52% Friday and rose above the mid-term downward trend and challenged the wave top 2.64 PCT However, market participants' rebound in Te's fiscal policy will surely increase worries over the rising cost of capital in the world, all of which are detrimental to the stock market of all mankind, including Hong Kong stocks.

I221df800f7a611e69042a971904437c3.1C,"利好陆续来
官方谷慢牛经过上周五的调整，内地股市昨天再度回升，沪深指数分别上升1.18%及1.29%，市场总成交金额为4988亿元（人民币．下同）。消息指，国务院计划下调企业所得税，另外首批约100亿元养老金，启动开户程序。全国「两会」召开前，利好经济及股市的消息相信陆续有来，A股表现可望持续有支撑。近期港股及A股均维持大涨小回的格局，向上攀升的势头仍未转变，尤其内地股市方面，其发展虽然受到央行收紧银根的影响，一旦养老金落实入市，仍有望吸引其他资金跟风买入，为市场注入新动力。内地媒体消息指，养老金最快或于本周入市，首批约100亿元的资金将分配给资产管理公司，预计盈利能力持续稳定的公司可望受到青睐。大型蓝筹，以及高增长民企股等可望受捧。此前已有报道称，包括北京、上海等7省市，共计3600亿元的基本养老基金，开始委託进行投资运营，以入市比例30%计算，即有约1080亿元的资金买股。今次首批100亿元资金或只是先试水温，只要市场表现不太疯狂，相信资金仍会陆续缓慢进场，以营造今年的A股「慢牛」。在目前宏观经济稳步回暖的情况下，民众消费能力提升，消费股的发展前景乐观，可望成为养老金吸纳的对象之一。最近包括白酒等诸多消费企业纷纷宣布加价，为企业股价带来支持。白酒及家电股升势突出昨天白酒及家电类消费股升势颇为突出，其中海信科龙（000921.SZ）升7%、老板电器（002508.SZ）升5.4%，而海信电器（600060.SH）及格力电器（000651.SZ）等升逾4%；酒类股份方面，五粮液（000858.SZ）、伊力特（600197.SH）、山西汾酒（600809.SH）等亦升逾半成。除了经济回暖的因素，经营模式转变也有望为消费行业带来新发展。过往投资者都在担心，网购行业将抢去传统百货企业的业务，但最近阿里巴巴积极与传统百货企业合作，以谋求共同发展。昨天阿里巴巴便宣布与上海百联集团签署合作，将透过互联网、物联网、人工智能及大数据等领先技术，发展网上网下（O2O）新型零售模式。受消息带动，百联股份（600827.SH）昨天涨停，其他百货股亦受带动，天虹商场（002419.SZ）升7%、鄂武商（000501.SZ）升5.5%。为免银根收紧影响股市表现，近期官方在托市方面想尽了方法，一方面透过养老金入市，为A股注入新水源，另一方面监管当局则透过收紧上市企业再融资，以减少过度「抽水」对股市带来负面影响。审议企业所得税法修订当局公布的融资新规提出，上市公司申请非公开发行股票，拟发行的股份数量不得超过发行前总股本的20%；两次增发、配股、非公开发行股票活动的时间不得少于18个月。除金融类企业外，融资不能用于借予他人及委託理财等财务性投资。由于两次「抽水」活动间要有至少18个月的间距，统计显示，过去一年半以来，有进行再融资活动的企业均会受到限制，今年年底前有超过700家上市公司不能通过定增融资。除了资金方面的利好消息之外，有消息指，明日（22日）召开的十二届全国人大常委会二十六次会议将审议国务院关于提请审议企业所得税法修正桉草桉的议桉。企业所得税是内地第二大税种，2016年收入总额达28850亿元，涉及千万户企业纳税人。目前内地企业所得税率为25%，对小微企业、高新技术企业实行优惠税率。现行税率在2007年3月获全国人大通过，由2008年1月1日起施行，事隔10年，或是时候再作检讨，尤其最近一段时间，美国、英国等纷纷提出减税建议，对环球市场竞争带来影响。中国税负偏高的问题经常被批评，减税措施值得探讨。减税利好经济，养老金入市则推动股市。官方持续释放利好消息，提振投资信心。沪指重上3300点，相信指日可待。

","Good to come one after another
After the adjustment on Friday, the domestic stock market rebounded again. The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock indexes rose 1.18% and 1.29% respectively.

The performance of A shares is expected to continue to be supported. Recently, Hong Kong stocks and A shares maintained the pattern of small gains and losses. The upward trend has not changed. In particular, although the development of the mainland stock market is affected by the central bank's tightening monetary policy, once the pension is implemented, it is still expected to attract other funds to follow suit Buy, inject new impetus into the market.

In order to prevent the tightening of the monetary tighten the performance of the stock market, the government recently tried its best to support the market. On the one hand, it injected a new source of water into the A-shares through the market of pensions. On the other hand, the supervisory authority, through tightening the refinancing of listed companies, To reduce the excessive ""pumping"" on the stock market has a negative impact.

I23345ab0466e11e7b74bc1df173b6fd0.1C,"非建制借张德江讲话製恐慌？日前全国人大常委会委员长张德江在纪念香港《基本法》实施二十周年座谈会上，再次申明「一国两制」下中央与香港的关係、强调国家统一和反「港独」决心、并再度明确指出本港实行「行政主导」体制。说实话，这些说法并非新鲜，对熟悉国情的人士来说是基本常识。然而，近日个别媒体和非建制派人士却再三炒作，把事情说成中央「推翻一国两制」、「收窄香港自治空间」，顿然引起一阵政治恐慌。政坛高人指出，有媒体公然打出「张德江推翻一国两制」的标题，非建制重磅人物又煞有介事说「行政主导」是要收窄香港自治空间云云，真是「知
就笑死，唔知就吓死」。以事论事，港府向来奉行「行政主导」，亦非首次被谈及，何来突然「收窄」甚至「推翻」之说呢？行政主导体制在港存在已久其实，特区政府奉行「行政主导」已久，与立法及司法另两「权」，充其量是「三权分治」、互相制衡，而不是非建派口中的立法与司法「大晒」的所谓「三权分立」。这些事实在「一国两制」倡导者邓小平当政时期就明确提出的，也贯穿本港政制设计。过往中央领导人也多次阐明。○二年本港回归五周年时，时任国家主席江泽民在庆祝回归五周大会讲话时就谈到，「要进一步落实行政主导体制」；○七年香港基本法实施十周年时，时任全国人大常委会委员长吴邦国更在讲话中直言「香港特区政治体制的最大特点是行政主导」。中央过去谈「行政主导」一向无风无浪，今天却被炒作成「推翻一国两制」，变的到底是中央还是炒作者本身？相信大家心中有数。事实上，近年所谓「本土」、「自决」意识崛起后，有媒体乃至政治人物屡屡歪曲中央意向、渲染盲目反中言论、製造政治恐慌，这才是对「一国两制」最大的挑战和破坏。如「港独」势力的兴起，就是在这种环境下酝酿出来，其本质就是不承认国家对香港恢复行使主权、企图把香港变成一个半独立甚至完全独立的政治实体，从国家分离出去。政坛高人分析，个别舆论和人士对张德江讲话的扭曲，也不外乎如此；其目的无非是藉机抽水、利用某些人的反对或「恐共」心理赚取政治本钱。同样手法屡试不爽，好些现在身居议员高位的政客也是「靠吓」起家。但扭曲终究是扭曲、假的真不了。在本港回归已成事实、「一国两制」有明确法律依据和准则前提下，任何恶意诋毁或者抹黑言论都站不住脚。同时中央对香港目前存在的一些对「一国两制」错误认知作出纠正和表态，也是对《基本法》的捍
和尊重。在自决、港独问题上，张德江明确指出「决不许以高度自治之名对抗中央」、「绝不对港独视若无睹」，可说是清清楚楚把中央的底
说给大众知道，望起正本清源之效。如果对违法言行一味纵容，任由「港独」发展下去，不仅全港七百三十万人共同「埋单」，后果也将是灾难性的。有人将中央纠错抹黑成推翻「一国两制」，本质上恰恰反映出这些人根本就不知道甚麽是「一国两制」，或证明这些人心埵陆迭C政客刻意歪曲《基本法》必须承认，过去几年来，本港社会撕裂加剧，坊间的确有媒体和反中政客不断炒作抹黑，多次製造反中或恐中情绪，妄图把特区和中央、两地人民，甚至本地不同政见的市民对立起来。如果全社会至今对「一国两制」的初衷、内容和基本原则还是一知半解，随
政客所製造的「假政治恐慌」而舞，香港怎可成为我们安身立命之地呢？！原姿晴前传媒人，现任职顾问来论

","Non-built by Zhang Dejiang speech panic? At a symposium commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the implementation of Hong Kong's ""Basic Law,"" recently, Zhang Dejiang, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, once again affirmed the central-Hongkong relationship under ""one country, two systems"", emphasized national unity and determination to oppose ""Hong Kong independence"" and once again made it clear that Hong Kong Implement ""administrative-led"" system. To be honest, these statements are not new and are common sense to those who are familiar with the national conditions. Recently, however, individual media and non-systemists repeatedly speculated that a political panic was suddenly caused by saying that things like ""overthrowing one country with two systems"" and ""narrowing Hong Kong's autonomy space"" by the Central Government. Political experts pointed out that some media outlets blatantly hit the title of ""Zhang Dejiang overthrows one country and two systems."" Non-fabricated heavywears have also said in a futile statement that ""administrative dominance"" is aimed at narrowing the autonomy space in Hong Kong.
Just laugh, do not know scared to death. In fact, the Hong Kong Government has always pursued an ""executive-led"" principle. Nor was it the first time that it was discussed. How can one suddenly ""narrow down"" or even ""overthrow"" it? Actually, the executive-led system has existed in Hong Kong for a long time. In fact, the SAR government has pursued an ""executive-led"" system for a long time and has the other two ""legislative powers and judicial powers"". At best, it is ""the separation of powers and the rule of law,"" checks and balances against each other, And the so-called ""separation of powers"" in the ""big sun"" of the judiciary. These facts were put forward explicitly during the reign of Deng Xiaoping, an advocate of ""one country, two systems,"" and they also permeate the design of our constitutional system. Past central leaders also repeatedly stated. ○ During the second year of Hong Kong's return to the fifth anniversary of the reunification, then-President Jiang Zemin remarked on the occasion of his return to the five-week conference to ""implement the system of administrative leadership"". ○ During the seven-year Hong Kong Basic Law, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress In his speech, Chairman Wu Bangguo said bluntly: ""The most prominent feature of the political system of the SAR is administration."" In the past, the Central Government talked about ""administrative domination"" which has always been a patternless style. Today it has been hyped into ""overthrowing one country, two systems."" In the end is the central government or the speculators themselves? I believe we know what's going on. In fact, after so-called ""indigenous"" and ""self-determination"" sentiments emerged in recent years, media and even political figures have repeatedly distorted the central intention, rendered blind anti-China remarks and created political panic. This is the greatest challenge and destruction to ""one country, two systems"". Such as the rise of the ""Hong Kong independence"" forces is brewing under such an environment. The essence of this is that it does not recognize that the country restores and exercises sovereignty over Hong Kong and attempts to turn Hong Kong into a semi-independent or even completely independent political entity separated from the country. Politicians have analyzed that individual public opinion and people are no more distorting about Zhang Dejiang's speech. Their purpose is nothing more than taking the opportunity to pump water and using some people's opposition or ""fear of communizing"" psychology to earn political capital. The same tactic has been tried out repeatedly. Some politicians who are now in high positions in the legislature also started by ""scare"". But after all, distortion is distorted, fake really. Given that Hong Kong's reunification has become a reality and that ""one country, two systems"" has clear legal bases and guidelines, any malicious vilification or discredit will be untenable. At the same time, the Central Government has made some corrections and statements on the mistaken understanding of ""one country, two systems"" currently existing in Hong Kong and also defends the ""Basic Law""
And respect. On the question of self-determination and self-determination and self-determination, Zhang Dejiang clearly pointed out: ""Never allow the Central Authorities to oppose the Central Government in the name of a high degree of autonomy."" ""We should never turn a blind eye to Hong Kong's independence."" It can be said that the Central Government
Said to the public know, looking forward to the original Qingyuan effect. If indulging in infringement of words and deeds, letting ""Hong Kong independence"" continue, not only will the 7.3 million people in Hong Kong jointly pay bills, the consequences will also be catastrophic. Some people have discredited the Central Government to correct ""one country, two systems,"" which essentially just means that these people simply do not know what ""one country or two systems"" or prove that these people are desperate. The politicians of Luding C deliberately distorted the ""Basic Law."" In the past few years, The tide of our society has worsened. There are indeed media outlets and anti-China politicians who continue to speculate on and discredit them. They have repeatedly fabricated anti-China and anti-terrorist sentiments in an attempt to antagonize the SAR, the Central People's Government, the people of the two places, and even the dissident citizens of Hong Kong. If the original intention, content and basic principles of ""one country, two systems"" are still widely understood in the whole society,
How can Hong Kong be the place where we live our lives in the dance of ""fake political panic"" made by politicians? !

I243a3b103abf11e7b14af5f1f3147b5c.1C,"谭志源：争取放宽港资金融机构进入大湾区，透过ＣＥＰＡ开拓市场
《经济通通讯社１７日专讯》政制及内地事务局局长谭志源以书面回答立法会金融服务界议员张华峰有关粤港澳大湾区发展规划提问表示，香港作为国家在粤港澳大湾区当中最国际化的城市，不但有「一国之利」，亦有「两制之便」，在大湾区可担当「超级联系人」的角色。在大湾区建设中，香港当充分发挥国家在《港澳专章》所赋予的独特定位，与大湾区内其他城市实现协调发展，并作为双向开放的平台，与大湾区城市拓展国际领域，配合国家「一带一路」策略。＊香港可支援离岸人币结算，助大湾区企业「走出去」＊
在金融服务业方面，特区政府正依据上述《港澳专章》的定位，从以下几方面配合和支持大湾区发展规划。
首先，香港在金融产业方面的优势和经验，将可与大湾区内不同的产业优势互补，开拓新商机。香港作为全球离岸人民币业务枢纽，可支援相关的离岸人民币结算、融资及资金管理需要。另外，随着深港通、沪港通及基金互认安排先后落实，市场上可供选择的人民币投资产品无论在数目和种类方面都大为增加，是理想的人民币资金和风险管理平台。
第二，香港与世界市场紧密互动的丰富经验及成熟的金融基建，可助大湾区内的企业「走出去」。鼓励大湾区内企业于香港成立企业财资中心，以进行集团内部的资金管理及风险管理活动；以及在香港设立专属自保保险公司，以提升风险管理能力效益。
第三，香港的资本市场稳健成熟，首次公开招股集资实力强健，可以为大湾区内的企业提供全面的投融资选择，并可吸引全球投资者。香港交易及结算所有限公司正探讨设立新板的可能性，从而为更多类型的发行人提供融资平台。＊争取放宽港资金融机构进入大湾区门槛，透过ＣＥＰＡ开拓市场＊
为推动大湾区的金融合作，特区政府会强化与大湾区金融服务的互联互通，开发更多的融资渠道和跨境金融服务去配合区内企业的发展。另一方面，特区政府会争取放宽港资金融机构进入大湾区的门槛、研究如何令大湾区内资源分配更具效率，例如降低香港与大湾区内其他城市进行实体及电子商贸的交易成本，优化和提升区域营商环境。
此外，《港澳专章》明确支持加大内地对港澳开放力度，推动内地与港澳关于建立更紧密经贸关系安排升级。香港会透过《内地与香港关于建立更紧密经贸关系安排》（《安排》）的进一步开放，让业界进一步开拓内地包括大湾区城市的市场，深化两地在不同产业上的共同发展和合作。就此，工业贸易署与国家商务部有常设机制就如何推进《安排》和落实现行开放措施进行沟通。特区政府现正与内地就投资和经济技术合作相关领域商讨扩大和优化《安排》，期望今年内会取得实质成果。特区政府会继续与内地当局商讨丰富《安排》内容的措施。＊支持旅发局与大湾区推动「一程多站」旅游发展＊
他又表示，就旅游业而言，粤港澳大湾区城市群地处中国南大门，拥有丰富的旅游资源，具有优厚条件发展成为世界级旅游区。香港作为多元化的旅游目的地，将会继续巩固与内地各省市，特别是大湾区城市的合作，进一步推动「一程多站」旅游的发展。特区政府会继续支持香港旅游发展局与大湾区城市建立合作平台，联手开发更多「一程多站」旅游产品，同时鼓励香港旅游业界把握大湾区的发展机遇，开发更多到大湾区的旅游产品给香港市民及「一程多站」的旅客。＊冀未来续安排香港各界人士到大湾区考察＊
谭志源又表示，特区政府希望能在未来继续安排香港各界人士到大湾区考察，了解区内城市的最新发展。行政长官早前会见传媒时表示，特区政府会就大湾区发展规划的意见提交予国家发改委考虑，预期国家发改委于今年内就规划定稿前，会就规划草稿徵询广东省政府及香港和澳门特区政府的意见。（ｂｉ）

","Tan Zhiyuan: Strive to relax Hong Kong-funded financial institutions into Greater Bay Area and open up markets through CEPA
""Economic News News Agency, 17th,"" Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Secretary Tan Chi-yuen to answer in writing the Legislative Council Member of the financial services sector Zhang Huafeng Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Tai Wanqu Development Planning Question said that Hong Kong as a country in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Bay Area among the most international The city not only has the ""benefit of one country,"" but also has ""two systems of control."" It can play a ""super-contact"" role in the Tai Wan District. In the construction of the Tai Wan District, Hong Kong should make full use of the unique positioning given by the country under the ""Hong Kong and Macao Special Regulations"" to achieve coordinated development with other cities in the Tai Wan area and serve as a platform for two-way opening up and for expanding the international community in the city of Tai Wan , In line with the country's ""Belt and Road"" strategy. * Hong Kong can support settlement of offshore renminbi and help Taiwanese companies ""go global"" *
In respect of the financial services industry, the SAR government is based on the above-mentioned ""Hong Kong and Macao monographs"" and supports and supports the development planning of the Tai Wan area from the following aspects.
First of all, Hong Kong's strengths and experience in the financial industry will complement each other's advantages in the industry in the Tai Wan area and open up new business opportunities. As a global offshore RMB business hub, Hong Kong can support the relevant offshore RMB clearing, financing and treasury management needs. In addition, with the implementation of the mutual recognition arrangements for Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and mutual funds, the number of available RMB investment products on the market has greatly increased both in terms of numbers and types of positions and is an ideal platform for RMB funds and risk management.
Second, the rich experience of Hong Kong's close interaction with the world market and its mature financial infrastructure can help enterprises in the Tai Wan Area ""go global."" Encouraging Tai Wan enterprises to set up corporate treasury centers in Hong Kong for intra-group fund management and risk management activities; and setting up dedicated self-insured insurance companies in Hong Kong so as to enhance the effectiveness of risk management capabilities.
Thirdly, Hong Kong's capital market has matured and its initial public offering of fund-raising is robust. It can provide enterprises in Tai Wan with a comprehensive range of investment and financing options and attract global investors. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited is exploring the possibility of setting up a new board to provide financing platforms for a broader range of issuers. * Strive to ease the threshold for Hong Kong-funded financial institutions to enter the Greater Wan Chau and open up markets through CEPA *
To promote the financial cooperation in the Tai Wan District, the SAR Government will step up its connectivity with the Tai Wan District financial services and develop more financing channels and cross-border financial services to meet the needs of the enterprises in the region. On the other hand, the SAR Government will strive to relax the threshold for Hong Kong-funded financial institutions to enter the Greater Bay Area and study how to make the distribution of resources within the Greater Bay Area more efficient. For example, it will lower the transactions between Hong Kong and other cities in the Greater Bay Area for physical and e-commerce Cost, optimize and enhance the business environment in the region.
In addition, the ""Hong Kong and Macao Chapter"" explicitly supports the Mainland to open up to Hong Kong and Maucao and promote the Mainland and Hong Kong and Maucao to establish closer economic and trade relations arrangements. Through further liberalization of the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), Hong Kong will allow the industry to further explore the Mainland market including the Tai Wan area and deepen the common development and cooperation between the two industries in different industries . In this connection, the Trade and Industry Department and the Ministry of Commerce have a permanent mechanism to communicate on how to move forward with the CEPA and implement the existing liberalization measures. The SAR government is now discussing with the Mainland the areas related to investment and economic and technological cooperation to broaden and optimize the CEPA. We hope that the tangible results will be achieved this year. The SAR Government will continue to discuss with the mainland authorities about the measures for enriching the ""arrangement"". * Support HKTB and Tai Wan to promote ""multi-destination"" tourism development *
He also said that as far as the tourism industry is concerned, the Metropolitan Area of ​​Tai Wan District of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau is located in the south gate of China and has abundant tourism resources. It has developed into a world-class tourist area with favorable conditions. As a diversified tourist destination, Hong Kong will continue to consolidate its cooperation with various provinces and cities in the Mainland, especially those in the Tai Wan District, and further promote the development of ""one-stop, multiple-trip"" tourism. The SAR Government will continue to support the Hong Kong Tourism Board in establishing a platform for cooperation with the city of Tai Wan to jointly develop more ""one-way, multiple-stop"" tourism products. At the same time, it will encourage Hong Kong's tourism industry to grasp the development opportunities in the Tai Wan area and to develop more The tourist products in the district give Hong Kong residents and travelers with more than one trip. * In the future, Hong Kong people from all walks of life will continue to visit Grand Bay Area for investigation *
Tan Zhiyuan also said that the SAR government hopes to continue to arrange Hong Kong people from all walks of life to visit the Greater Bay Area in the future and learn about the latest developments in the cities in the area. When the Chief Executive met with the media earlier, he said the SAR government will submit its views on the development planning of the Tai Wan area to the NDRC for consideration. It is expected that before the finalization of the plan by the NDRC this year, the draft plan will be consulted by the Guangdong Provincial Government and Hong Kong and Macao Advice from SAR Government.
