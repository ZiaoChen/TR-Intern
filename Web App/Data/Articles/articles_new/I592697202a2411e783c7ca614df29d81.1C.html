It removed the threat of anti-EU far-right rule with European and US stock markets strongly advancing. Following the colossal defeat of the far-right party in the Netherlands, the EU could again breathe a sigh of relief. It now remains to be seen if there will be any black swans in the UK and Germany elections.<BR/>As the young and handsome 39-year-old French "Little Brother Ma" took the lead in the election, the euro quickly went up against the US dollar by one per cent. Three major European markets rose with the Paris CAC rising most sharply by four per cent to a two-year high. Three major US indexes also opened about one per cent higher with the Nasdaq approaching 6,000. Furthermore, the Hong Kong market opened 143 points higher, losing steam later due to mainland factors.<BR/>The markets have cleared concerns about a contest between far-right Marine Le Pen and far-left Jean-Luc Melenchon, especially when the former advocates renegotiating EU treaties and higher autonomy. France is a member of not only the EU but also the common currency euro. Its exit from the EU will not only hit hard on the union's politics and finance but also affect world economy.<BR/>In the French election system, if no one wins more than half the votes in the first round, two candidates with the highest votes will enter a run-off. In the past 60 years, it was mostly between the traditional right Republican Party and left Socialist Party but this is the first time with the two large parties losing. After far-left Melenchon also lost, they urged for voters' "support", making Macron's votes soar above 60 per cent. He is hopeful of beating Le Pen to become France's youngest president on May 7.<BR/>Revival of French economy still very hard<BR/>Macron becoming front runner has cleared doubts about EU exit, but reviving the country's economy and reducing the nearly 10 per cent unemployment rate, especially 25 per cent for youths, are still very difficult.<BR/>Though Macron came from the Socialist Party, he started a new party to run for the election, taking a centrist line. One of the economic deadlocks is the impasse in worker protection leading to businesses unwilling to hire new employees. At present the parliament is controlled by the two traditional parties. Whether Macron's reform to relax regulation on businesses will receive support from the parliament is still unknown.<BR/>His ultimate opponent Le Pen defeated two mainstream parties to enter the run-off. EU exit is only one of her highlights to gain support from many grassroots dissatisfied with their current situation. Like US President Donald Trump, she puts the blame for high unemployment rate and poor business on competition from migrants and giant enterprises that come with economic globalization, mixing populism and patriotism to strive for support and even positioning the election as a fight between the people and elites.<BR/>Far-right loses but support is growing<BR/>Le Pen seems destined to lose next month but the number of votes she eventually receives should be noted. In the Netherlands election last month, although the ruling party won, far-right legislator Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom got five more seats to become the second largest party. Le Pen in this round won about 10 million votes, 2.8 million more than her father who entered the second round of election 15 years ago.<BR/>The turnout rate this time was as high as 79 per cent while it was 80 per cent in the Netherlands, showing that voters are extremely concerned about the country's future. After Macron became the front runner, many EU leaders were not slow to celebrate, which indirectly reflects the concern brought by far-right populism expansion. Put before France and the EU are many hurdles yet to overcome.<BR/>翻譯自四月二十五日《星島日報》社論<BR/>（http://std.stheadline.com/）<BR/>Vocabulary<BR/>centrist (n) —— 中間派<BR/>advance (v) —— 上漲<BR/>steam (n) —— 動力<BR/>renegotiate (v) —— 重新談判<BR/>treaty (n) —— 條約<BR/>run-off (n) —— 決勝選舉<BR/>ultimate (adj) —— 終極的<BR/>elite (n) —— 社會精英<BR/>Useful Terms<BR/>colossal defeat —— 巨大失敗<BR/>economic globalization —— 經濟全球化<BR/>ruling party —— 執政黨<BR/>turnout rate —— 投票率<BR/>Did you know<BR/>European stock markets surged, and France's main index hit its highest level since early 2008, as investors gambled that the rise of populism around the world - and its associated unpredictability in policymaking - may have peaked. France's divided political mainstream, rejected by an angry electorate, united to urge voters to back Macron and reject Le Pen's far-right agenda. French President Francois Hollande said he would vote for Macron, his former economy minister, because Le Pen represents "both the danger of the isolation of France and of rupture with the European Union".<BR/>1.
