Meanwhile, 17 percent will consider the mainland, unchanged from last year.<BR/>The club also found students' understanding of mainland universities has increased in general, while knowledge of Taiwanese ones has fallen.<BR/>The club collected about 1,700 questionnaires from 26 schools last month, asking about the HKDSE candidates' intentions and understanding of tertiary education in Taiwan and the mainland.<BR/>Director of the club's student guidance centre (学友社学生辅导中心) Ng Po-shing (吴宝城) said the drop in HKDSE candidate numbers may be the main reason for fewer students considering Taiwan for higher education, as it is now relatively easier to be admitted to one of the institutions in Hong Kong.<BR/>"In the past, a lot of students chose Taiwan because the entry requirement is considerably lower," Ng said.<BR/>The poll also found the most effective ways of understanding Taiwan and mainland higher education were through talks (38 percent) and discussion with teachers (24 percent).<BR/>(The Standard, 27 February)<BR/>Hong Kong's outbound numbers continue to rise<BR/>https://goo.gl/EdK50q<BR/>Hok Yau Club press release on survey<BR/>https://goo.gl/lxKzLy<BR/>5 words to know<BR/>graduate (n) 毕业生<BR/>•Many graduates of our school were accepted by universities last year.<BR/>knowledge (n) 知识<BR/>•This examination tests our knowledge on the Basic Law.<BR/>intention (n) 意图；意向<BR/>•The teacher asked about my intention regarding higher education.<BR/>guidance (n) 指导<BR/>•Students in higher grades are expected to provide guidance to newcomers.<BR/>requirement (n) 要求<BR/>•Physical fitness is a key requirement of joining the police force.<BR/>Writing Tips<BR/>Considerably is an adverb that means by a notably large amount or to a notably large extent; greatly.<BR/>•Emma's grades have improved considerably over the last few months.<BR/>A related word is considerable, an adjective that means notably large in size, amount or extent.<BR/>•The chairman of the board has considerable clout in the commercial sector.<BR/>Consider is a verb that means to think carefully about (something), typically before making a decision.<BR/>•The school considered each application for admission carefully.<BR/>The word also means to regard (someone or something) as having a specified quality.<BR/>•I consider this to be an invasion of my privacy.<BR/>All thing considered means taking everything into account.<BR/>•All things considered, I think the performance was a success.<BR/></P></BODY></HTML>
