Beilock说，大家对数学的态度也很特别：<BR/>People are very happy to say they don't like math. No one walks around bragging that they can't read, but it's perfectly socially acceptable to say you don't like math.<BR/>Brag解say something in a boastful manner，吹嘘、夸耀︰He is always bragging about how smart he is.(他常吹嘘自己是如何聪明。)Stop bragging! (别吹牛！)<BR/>很多人不介意甚至很喜欢对人说自己不喜欢数学，但你却很少看到有人吹嘘自己不懂得阅读。这反映说自己数学差劲是社会普遍接受的。<BR/>很多人不喜欢math，情况不是今天才出现，有学术论文指出：<BR/>Many studies over the years have indicated that many people have extremely negative(极端负面的) attitudes to mathematics, sometimes amounting to severe anxiety.<BR/>恶性循环<BR/>原来对数学的不喜爱是可以达到严重焦虑的程度，这种心理还有专有名称，叫"mathematics anxiety"(数学焦虑)，症状是：<BR/>"... a feeling of tension and anxiety that interferes(妨碍、扰乱) with the manipulation(处理、运用) of numbers and the solving of mathematical problems in ... ordinary life and academic(学术的) situations."<BR/>"Researchers probe causes of math anxiety"一文指出，math anxiety的影响可以很大：<BR/>Experts argue that "math anxiety" can bring about widespread(广泛的、普遍的), intergenerational(跨代的) discomfort with the subject, which could lead to anything from fewer students pursuing math and science careers to less public interest in financial markets.<BR/>有很多研究想找出math anxiety的原因及改善方法。Sian L. Beilock说︰"simply suggesting to college students that they would be asked to take a math test triggered a stress response in the hypothalamus(下丘脑) of students with high math anxiety."<BR/>若学生紧张，对数学感到压力，数学测验考试表现就会较差，成绩差又会令紧张忧虑加剧，令表现更差，成为了恶性循环。<BR/>University of Western Ontario(西安大略大学)专门研究数字认知的Numerical Cognition Laboratory学者Daniel Ansari解释：<BR/>When engaged in mathematical problem-solving, highly math-anxious individuals suffer from intrusive(入侵的、打扰的) thoughts and ruminations(反覆思量).<BR/>This takes up some of their processing and working memory. It's very much as though individuals with math anxiety use up the brainpower(脑力) they need for the problem on worrying.<BR/>Learning to Love Math: Teaching Strategies That Change Student Attitudes and Get Results的作者、神经科专家Judy Willis说︰"anxiety can literally(确实地) cut off the working memory needed to learn and solve problems."<BR/>但她认为，不论是学生、家长、老师，都有方法消除对数学的抗拒，并爱上这门学问。<BR/>文︰子慧<BR/>作者是资深传媒工作者，历任中、英文报章管理层。<BR/></P></BODY></HTML>
