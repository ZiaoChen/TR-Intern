The government wants Legco to pass the law before Leung Chun-ying's term as chief executive ends on June 30. Government officials do not want to leave this very sensitive issue to the next chief executive. They say it is essential (very important) for Hong Kong and mainland immigration officials to handle departing and arriving passengers at the main terminus in Hong Kong. They say passengers should be able to go through immigration in one place because if they have to go through Hong Kong immigration at West Kowloon and mainland immigration across the border, it would waste time, making the high-speed railway meaningless.<BR/>　　But opposition Legco members do not want mainland officials in Hong Kong. They say it violates the Basic Law to let mainland officials apply mainland immigration laws here. They also fear mainland officials may arrest Hong Kong people for political reasons. That's why Tien Puk-sun is skeptical Legco will pass a law that allows mainland immigration officials here. He said in a radio interview it would be a “divine miracle” for Legco to pass such a law before June. To be skeptical means to be unconvinced or doubtful that something can happen. A miracle is something extraordinary that happens which cannot be explained by nature or science and is believed to be caused by God.<BR/>　　The word “divine” means something that is connected to God. When Tien Puk-sun said it would be a “divine miracle” for Legco to pass the law before June, he meant it can only happen with God's help. Tien Puk-sun could simply have said “miracle” without the word “divine”. Or he could have said “divine intervention”, which means God's involvement in something that happens to humans. For example, it would require divine intervention for Longhair Leung Kwok-hung to win the chief executive election. The word “divine” also means very good. You can say: “The pizza I ate for dinner was divine”.<BR/>***立法会是否能快速通过订立新的法例，允许内地入境官员于开往广州的西九龙高铁总站驻守，新民党常务副主席田北辰对此表示怀疑（skeptical）。政府希望立法会可在六月三十日梁振英的特首任期完结前通过法例。政府官员不想将这个异常敏感的议题留给下届特首。他们说，香港和内地入境官员得以在香港的总站处理出入境乘客，至为重要（essential）。他们说，乘客必须在同一地点办妥出入境手续，因为若他们要在西九出香港的关口，又要在另一边关口入境内地，这就是浪费时间，令高速铁路变得毫无意义。<BR/>　　然而，反对派的立法会议员不想让内地官员驻守香港，他们说容许内地官员在这媢磟I内地的出入境法律，是违反了《基本法》，也担忧内地官员会因为政治原因而拘捕香港人。因此田北辰对于立法会可以立例允许内地官员驻守在此表示怀疑（skeptical）。他在一电台访问上说，若立法会可以在六月前通过一个这样的法例，简直就是“divine miracle” 。To be skeptical 意思就是对于某事能否发生感到怀疑或抱有疑问。Miracle是奇蹟，就是一些超现实的状况，未能以自然或科学解释，只能相信是神蹟或神的作为。<BR/>　　Divine就是指与上帝有关的。当田北辰说立法会在六月前通过新法是个“divine miracle”，他的意思是只有靠上帝的帮助这才能成真。田北辰其实可以简单说“miracle”便可，不用加“divine”一字；又或者他可以说“divine intervention”，即是神介入人类的生活当中。譬如，长毛梁国雄要在特首选举中胜出，可真要神助（divine intervention）了。Divine也指极好的，你可以说：「我晚餐时吃的那个薄饼真的妙极（divine）了！」<BR/>??＊我的专栏已加上 QR code，你只须用手机扫描 QR code，就可以聆听我朗读专栏的录音，希望这能帮助大家改善英文字词的发音。mickchug@gmail.com<BR/>逢周二及四见报<BR/></P></BODY></HTML>
