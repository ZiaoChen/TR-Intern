Researchers have found that older people can have a harder time spotting(认出) liars, probably because of a decline in "emotional recognition(情绪的认知)," or the ability to read others' emotions accurately, the fraud researchers at the Stanford center said. But elders' long experience in life also helps them spot fraud. On balance, they aren't more susceptible than anyone else.<BR/>Susceptible解易受影响的。有研究发现，识破骗子的能力会因年迈而降低；但研究欺骗的专家又发现，「人老精」的说法确有根据，老人家人生经验丰富，有助他们「抗骗」，所以总的来说，他们并非特别susceptible。<BR/>大家觉得年轻人一定比较「精灵」，但原来他们却较易上当：<BR/>Contrary to popular wisdom, younger adults actually are more vulnerable than older people. People 18 to 25 stood a 77 percent chance of becoming victims compared to people 65 to 75, who had a 44 percent chance, according to the study.<BR/>Scam artists(骗子) alter their tactics depending on the unique vulnerability of their targets. A young woman might not fall for a "grandparents scam" (in which con artists pose as a grandchild in trouble) but she might fall for a weight loss scheme or a juice cleanse or an anti-aging cream because she feels insecure about aging.<BR/>Vulnerable解脆弱的、地位不稳固的、易受影响的、易受伤害的、易受攻击的。To be vulnerable to pressure是易受压力影响。Vulnerable 和susceptible意思相近，都指对一些不利的因素、情况、疾病等抵抗力弱，易受伤害的。<BR/>便宜莫贪 三思决定<BR/>面对层出不穷的行骗手法，要自保就应还原基本步。首先是「光棍佬教仔」的做法：便宜莫贪。<BR/>With things you find free, especially online, consider the motivation(动机) of those offering it. If you're being asked for a lot of personal information, that information could be sold - perhaps to someone you'd rather not have it.<BR/>网上有很多免费的东西，但取用前要想想为甚麽有人会给你这样的便宜。Download免费软件可能会下载了病毒；提供个人资料，后果更堪虞。<BR/>另外，"Haste(仓促) lays your savings to waste"。Lay to waste解to destroy something; to ruin or mess up something，破坏、摧毁。有人向你大力推销，提供看来极吸引的优惠，千万不要因怕错过机会而仓促做决定。<BR/>From buying a house to getting married, the time spent on a decision should directly correlate to its potential ramifications(潜在的后果).<BR/>James Munton和Jelita McLeod合着的The Con: How Scams Work, Why You're Vulnerable, and How to Protect Yourself，是防骗大法。<BR/>文︰子慧<BR/>作者是资深传媒工作者，历任中、英文报章管理层。<BR/></P></BODY></HTML>
