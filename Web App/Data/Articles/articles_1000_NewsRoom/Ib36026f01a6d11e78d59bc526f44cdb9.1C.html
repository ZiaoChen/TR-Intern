To vilify means to strongly criticize in an unfair way to damage someone's reputation. I support the people's right to protest peacefully but the Occupy protests were not totally peaceful. Some of those who took part clashed with the police. The word "clash" used this way means to fight. Seven policemen were recently jailed for beating up a protester during the Occupy protests. But many people used this to vilify the whole police force.<BR/>　　Last week I read that a young policeman, Man Wai-dik, went above and beyond the call of duty to help an elderly man in Tsuen Wan. The expression "above and beyond the call of duty" means to do much more than what your job requires you to do. The elderly man was carrying a pole (long thick stick) on his shoulder with heavy items on both ends of the pole. Man Wai-dik saw that the elderly man was having difficulty carrying the heavy load. He took the pole from the old man, put it on his own shoulder, and carried the load to the man's home. What the policeman did went above and beyond the call of duty because policemen do not have to help people carry things.<BR/>　　A passer-by took a picture of the policeman carrying the heavy pole on his shoulder and put it on the internet. The picture went viral. When something goes viral it means it spreads very quickly and widely on the internet. I hope Hong Kong people will think before they vilify the whole police force. Man Wai-dik showed Hong Kong people that not all policemen beat people up. We should not paint the entire police force with the same brush just because seven policemen were jailed for beating up a protester. The expression "paint someone with the same brush" means to think someone has the same bad qualities as others who have done bad things.<BR/>***　<BR/>在2014年佔中示威期间，香港警队被许多人和部份的媒体诋毁（vilified）。To vilify的意思就是诋毁或诽谤某人。我支持和平示威的人权，但佔领运动也不全是和平的示威。有些参与者会冲击（clashed）警方。Clash在这堛荧N思是去冲撞、打斗。最近，有七名警员因在佔领示威期间殴打一名示威者而被判监，许多人就以此来诋毁（vilify）整个警队。<BR/>　　上星期我读到一则新闻，报道一位年轻警员文伟迪在荃湾帮助一名老人，是超出了其职责范围（above and beyond the call of duty）。习语 above and beyond the call of duty意即你的付出是超越职责范围的要求。那伯伯正用肩膀扛蚞嶈D，竹竿（pole）的两边都挂茩囿哄C文伟迪见到伯伯的重物难担，于是取来竹竿（pole），亲自肩负起担挑回伯伯的住处。这名警员所做的确实是超出职责范围以外的付出（above and beyond the call of duty），因为警察是不需要帮人提重物的。<BR/>　　警员肩担沉重竹竿（pole）的情景，被一位路人拍了照并放上网，相片就被疯传了（viral）。当某事goes viral意即它传播得很快，在网上爆红。我希望香港人在诋毁（vilify）整个警队前可以三思。文伟迪示范了给香港人看，不是所有警员都会殴打市民的。我们不应只因七名警员因为殴打示威者而被判监，便 paint the entire police force with the same brush。习语 paint someone with the same brush 的意思就是不分青红皂白，「一竹篙打一船人」。<BR/>mickchug@gmail.com<BR/>中译：七刻<BR/>Michael Chugani 匟硃<BR/>＊我的专栏已加上 QR code，你只须用手机扫描 QR code，就可以聆听我朗读专栏的录音，希望这能帮助大家改善英文字词的发音。<BR/>mickchug@gmail.com<BR/></P></BODY></HTML>
