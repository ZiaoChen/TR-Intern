We do things the same old way because it's comfortable."(人被习惯操控。跟习惯行事让我们觉得舒服。)<BR/>Comfort zone有甚麽不好？为何有人劝告我们要走出comfort zone？Sally Deneen引述奥运运动员教练Denis Waitley的话：<BR/>But the risk in staying firmly inside our comfort zones is that it creates psychological barriers(心理的障碍) that can lead to real limitations(限制、局限), says author and speaker Denis Waitley, who has advised Olympic athletes on how to gain a mental edge(心理优势). Because we haven't done anything dynamic in a long time, we begin to think we can't, he explains.<BR/>Dynamic解energetic、positive，充满活力的，characterized by change，动态的。天天做相同的事，会令我们失去活力和尝试新事物的动力，久而久之，生命的范围就会变得局限。<BR/>Megan Nicole O'Neal在"Why your comfort zone is the most dangerous place to live"(〈为甚麽舒适地带最危险〉)一文中，也指出永远活在comfort zone的坏处：<BR/>We can become disinterested(不感兴趣的、不关心的、冷漠的), uninvolved(不参与的、不投入的) and often so paralyzed by our daily lives that we forget there is an entire world out there.<BR/>凡事漠不关心<BR/>她说踏出comfort zone不容易，有时会令人"floating"(飘浮)，或有"walking onto a frozen lake that's beginning to thaw"(走进刚溶解的冰湖)的感觉。<BR/>但做惯了，就愈来愈容易︰<BR/>It's a rewiring(重新接 ) of your brain, and similar to learning a new language, the more you practice, the more naturally it flows. Until one day you realize you've been thinking and dreaming in this new language without even trying.<BR/>Your comfort zone is killing you: Finding the courage to be you的作者Billy Anderson就指出，生命到了尽头，最多人感到最大的懊悔是："I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."(「我希望有活出真我的勇气，而非跟别人的旨望而活。」)然而要活出真我，就要走出comfort zone。<BR/>文︰子慧<BR/></P></BODY></HTML>
