Female participants in both places are more likely to be addicted to shopping.<BR/>"Shopping is not the road to real happiness and inner peace," said Greenpeace campaigner Bonnie Tang Man-lam.<BR/>"Hong Kong people wish to gain happiness and self-confidence via shopping, but when the short-term satisfaction is gone, all you can get is an overdrawn credit card, a closet full of unwanted clothes, and an even emptier feeling."<BR/>More than half (60 percent) of the respondents said excitement from the purchases vanished in less than a day, and 35 percent of shoppers found that once these feelings had worn off, they felt even emptier than before.<BR/>(The Standard,<BR/>25 January)<BR/>5 words to know<BR/>shopaholic (n) 购物狂<BR/>•Many people love shopping but that does not mean they are all shopaholics.<BR/>conservation (n) 保存；保护<BR/>•We must step up conservation efforts to prevent heritage buildings from disappearing.<BR/>counterpart (n) 对应的人或物<BR/>•Hong Kong officials met their counterparts from Shenzhen to discuss border control issues.<BR/>overdrawn (adj) 透支的<BR/>•A shopping spree has left me with an overdrawn bank account.<BR/>excitement (n) 兴奋<BR/>•The party was filled with fun and excitement.<BR/>Writing Tips<BR/>Satisfaction is a noun that means fulfilment of one's wishes, expectations, or needs, or the pleasure derived from this.<BR/>•I am leaving the company because I am not getting any job satisfaction.<BR/>Satisfy is a verb that means to meet the expectations, needs, or desires of (someone).<BR/>•People who are never satisfied with what they have will not be happy.<BR/>The word also means to adequately meet or comply with (a condition, obligation, or demand).<BR/>Satisfying is an adjective that means giving fulfilment or the pleasure associated with this.<BR/>•Our outing to Cheung Chau was very satisfying.<BR/>Satisfactory is also an adjective.
