The broadcaster's subsidiary, TVB Network Vision, blamed online piracy, government inaction, outdated regulations and intense competition from internet rivals for the move.<BR/>It said it had tried hard to keep the service going despite difficulties but a "deteriorating business and operating environment in recent years have rendered the pay TV business not commercially viable".<BR/>"Regrettably, the government has done little to address the issues, particularly online piracy and some of the regulatory provisions which do not keep up with the times, and foster an environment that supports sustained development of the TV industry," a spokesman said.<BR/>"Virtually all the contents provided by TVBNV have been pirated and made available on a large number of illicit websites, apps and set-top-boxes which led to increasing subscriber churn rate."<BR/>The service, launched in 2004, will end once the government has accepted the surrender of the licence. Subscriptions will not be renewed on expiry.<BR/>The pay TV arm of TVB saw its golden days in 2013 when there were 200,000 subscribers. The number has been falling since. The pay TV licence was renewed for a further period of 12 years from 2013.<BR/>There are two other local pay TV services - Cable TV and Now TV, operated by Hong Kong Cable Television Ltd and PCCW Media Ltd, r<BR/>espectively.<BR/>(The Standard, 11 January)<BR/>6 words to know<BR/>surrender (v) 交还<BR/>•Club members are required to surrender their access cards when their memberships expire.<BR/>expire (v) 期满<BR/>•This lease will expire in less than six months.<BR/>deteriorating (adj) 不断恶化的<BR/>•In a deteriorating economy, a lot of people will lose their jobs.<BR/>viable (adj) 切实可行的<BR/>•The experts do not think that this design is scientifically viable.<BR/>regrettably (adv) 遗憾地<BR/>•Regrettably we have to stop the free training programme because there is no money.<BR/>foster (v) 培养；促进<BR/>•There is a weekly gathering to foster the spirit of cooperation between different classes.<BR/>Writing Tips<BR/>Address, used as a verb, means to think about and begin to deal with (an issue or problem).<BR/>•Problems will become more serious if they are not addressed right away.<BR/>•The official's speech addressed the issue of air pollution.<BR/>The word also means to speak to (a person or an assembly).<BR/>•The head of the administration usually addresses the Legislative Council at the start of a new session.<BR/>Address also refers to the specific name or title we use to call someone when we speak to them.<BR/>•In court, we address the judge as Your Honour.<BR/>•My teacher likes us to address her as Mrs Wong.<BR/>The word also means writing the name and address of the intended recipient on a letter or parcel.<BR/>•The protesters addressed their petition to the chief executive directly.<BR/>Address, as a noun, means the particulars of the place where someone lives or an organisation is situated.<BR/>•Some parents use a fake address when they apply for their children's schooling.<BR/></P></BODY></HTML>
